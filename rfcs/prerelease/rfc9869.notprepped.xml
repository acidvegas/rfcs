    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies how a UDP Options sender implements Datagram
      Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD)
      as a robust method for Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD). This
      method uses the UDP Options packetization layer. It allows an
      application to discover the largest size of datagram that can be sent
      across a network path. It also provides a way to allow the application
      to periodically verify the current Maximum Packet Size (MPS) supported by a
      path and to update this when required.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref target="RFC0768" format="default"/> offers a
            minimal transport service on top of IP and is frequently used as a
            substrate for other protocols. Section <xref target="RFC8085" sectionFormat="bare" section="3.2"/> of UDP Guidelines <xref target="RFC8085" format="default"/> recommends that applications implement some
            form of Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) to avoid the generation of IP fragments:</t>
      <blockquote>Consequently, an application <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> either use the path MTU
            information provided by the IP layer or implement Path MTU Discovery
            (PMTUD) itself [RFC1191] [RFC1981] [RFC4821] to determine whether the
   path to a destination will support its desired message size without
   fragmentation.</blockquote>
      <t>The UDP API <xref target="RFC8304" format="default"/> offers calls for
            applications to receive ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages and to
            control the maximum size of datagrams that are sent, but it does not offer
            any automated mechanisms for an application to discover the MPS
            supported by a path. Upper Layer protocols, which
            include applications, can
            implement mechanisms for PMTUD above the UDP API.</t>
      <t>Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (PLPMTUD) <xref target="RFC4821" format="default"/>
            describes a method for a bidirectional Packetization Layer (PL)
            to search for the largest Packetization Layer PMTU (PLPMTU) supported on
            a path. DPLPMTUD <xref target="RFC8899" format="default"/>
            specifies this support for datagram transports. PLPMTUD and DPLPMTUD
            gain robustness by using a probing mechanism that does not solely rely on
            ICMP PTB messages and works on paths that drop ICMP PTB messages.</t>
      <t>UDP Options <xref target="RFC9868" format="default"/> supplies
            functionality that can be used to implement DPLPMTUD within the
            transport service or in an Upper Layer protocol (including an application)
            that uses UDP Options. 
            This document specifies how DPLPMTUD using UDP Options
            is implemented (<xref target="RFC8899" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1"/>)
            and requires support to be enabled at both the sender and receiver.
      </t>
      <t>Implementing DPLPMTUD within the
            transport service above UDP Options avoids the need for
            each Upper Layer protocol to implement the DPLPMTUD
            method. It provides a standard method for applications to discover the
            current MPS for a path and to detect when this
            changes. It can be used with Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) routing
           and/or multihoming. If multipath or multihoming is supported,
           a state machine is needed for each path.</t>
      <t>DPLPMTUD is not specified for multicast. The method requires
           explicit acknowledgement of probe packets provided by UDP Options,
           which is primarily intended for unicast use (see 
           <xref target="RFC9868" sectionFormat="of" section="23"/>).</t>

      <name>DPLPMTUD for UDP Options</name>
      <t>A UDP Options sender implementing DPLPMTUD uses the method specified
            in <xref target="RFC8899" format="default"/>. In this specification, DPLPMTUD is
            realized using a pair of
            UDP Options:
            the Request (REQ) Option and the Response (RES) Option
            (<xref target="RFC9868" sectionFormat="of" section="11.7"/>).
            The method also uses the End of Options List (EOL) Option
            (<xref target="RFC9868" sectionFormat="of" section="11.1"/>) to
            introduce padding to set the size of a probe packet.</t>
      <t>Use of DPLPMTUD <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be explicitly enabled by the application, for instance,
            once an application has established connectivity and is ready
            to exchange data with the remote Upper Layer protocol.
            Similarly, a DPLPMTUD receiver <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> respond to a UDP REQ
            Option until DPLPMTUD has been enabled. This is to help
            protect from misuse of the mechanism for other forms of probing.</t>
      <t>Probe packets consume network capacity and incur endpoint
            processing (<xref target="RFC8899" sectionFormat="of" section="4.1"/>).
            Implementations ought to send a probe packet with a UDP REQ
            Option only when required by their local DPLPMTUD state machine,
            i.e., when confirming the base PMTU for the path,
            probing to increase the PLPMTU, or confirming the current
            PLPMTU.</t>
      <t>DPLPMTUD can be implemented
            over UDP Options in two ways:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Implementation within the UDP transport service.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Implementation in an Upper Layer protocol (or application) that uses UDP Options.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>When DPLPMTUD is implemented within the UDP
            transport service, the DPLPMTUD state machine
            is responsible for sending probe packets to determine a PLPMTU, as described
            in this document. This determines an MPS,
            the largest size of application data block that can be sent across a network path
            using a single datagram. The Upper Layer protocol is responsible for deciding
            when a session enables DPLPMTUD.</t>
      <t>The discovered PLPMTU can be used to either:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t> set the maximum datagram size for the current path or</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t> set the maximum fragment size when a sender uses the
                    UDP Fragmentation Option to divide a datagram into
                    multiple UDP fragments for transmission. The size of each UDP fragment
                    is then less than or equal to the size of the discovered largest IP packet that can
                    be received across the current path.
          </t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>The figure below shows an implementation of DPLPMTUD within the UDP
            transport service.
            It illustrates key interactions between the layers.
            This design requires an API primitive to allow the application to
            control whether the DPLPMTUD state machine is enabled for a specific
      UDP port. By default, this API <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> disable DPLPMTUD processing.</t>

    <aside>
      <t>Note: UDP allows an Upper Layer protocol
            to send datagrams with or without payload data (with or without
            UDP Options). These
            are delivered across the network to the remote Upper Layer.
            When DPLPMTUD is implemented within the UDP
            transport service, probe packets that include a REQ or RES UDP Option
            can be sent with no UDP payload.
            In this case, these probe packets were not generated by a sending
            application; therefore, the corresponding received datagrams are
      not delivered to the remote application.</t>
    </aside>
      <t>When DPLPMTUD is instead implemented by an Upper Layer protocol,
            the format and content
            of probe packets are determined by the Upper Layer protocol.
            This design is also permitted to use the REQ and RES Options
            provided by UDP Options.</t>
      <t>If DPLPMTUD is active at more than one layer,
            then the values of the tokens used in REQ Options need to be coordinated
            with any values used for other DPLPMTUD probe packets to ensure
            that each probe packet can be identified by a unique token.
            When configurable, a configuration ought to avoid
            performing such discovery both within UDP Options
            and also by an Upper Layer protocol 
            that sends and receives probe packets via UDP Options.
            <xref target="RFC8899" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1"/> recommends that:
            "An application <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> avoid using DPLPMTUD when the underlying
            transport system provides this capability."</t>
      <section anchor="formats" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Packet Formats</name>
        <t>The UDP Options used in this document are described in
                <xref target="RFC9868" format="default"/> and are used
                in the following ways:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>The REQ Option is set by a sending PL to solicit a response from a
                    remote receiver. A four-byte (four-octet) token identifies each request.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A sending PL can use the EOL Option together with a minimum
                    datagram length to pad probe packets.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The RES Option is sent by a UDP Options receiver in response to a
                    previously received REQ Option. Each RES Option echoes the last received
                    four-byte token.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t> If a UDP Options  endpoint creates and sends a datagram
                    with a RES Option solely as response to a received REQ Option,
                    the responder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> limit the rate of these responses
                    (e.g., limiting each pair of ports to send 1 per measured RTT or
                    1 per second). This rate limit is to mitigate the DoS vector
                    without significantly impacting the operation of DPLPMTUD.
                    An example in <xref target="examples" format="default"/>
                    describes a case where this might be used.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>
                    Reception of a RES Option by the REQ sender confirms that a specific
                    probe packet has been received by the remote UDP Options receiver.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The token allows a UDP Options sender to distinguish
            between acknowledgements for initial probe packets and
            acknowledgements confirming receipt of subsequent probe packets
            (e.g., travelling along alternate paths with a larger RTT).
            Each probe packet <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be uniquely
            identifiable by the UDP Options sender within the Maximum Segment
            Lifetime (MSL) <xref target="RFC8085" format="default"/>.
            The UDP Options sender <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> reuse
            a token value within the MSL. A
            four-byte value for the token field provides sufficient space for
            multiple unique probe packets to be made within the MSL. Since UDP Options
            operates over UDP, the token values only need to be unique for
            the specific 5-tuple over which it is operating.
        </t>
        <t>The value of the four-byte token field <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be initialized
            to a randomized value to enhance protection from off-path attacks,
            as described in <xref target="RFC8085" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1"/>.</t>

        <name>Receiving UDP Options Probe Packets and Sending the RES Option</name>
        <t>When DPLPMTUD is enabled, a UDP Options receiver responds
            by sending a UDP datagram with the RES Option when
            it receives a UDP Options datagram with
            the REQ Option.</t>
        <t>The operation of DPLPMTUD can depend on the support at
            the remote UDP Options endpoint, the way in which DPLPMTUD
            is implemented, and in some cases, the application data that is
            exchanged over the UDP transport service.
            When UDP Options is not supported by the remote receiver,
            DPLPMTUD will be unable to confirm the path or to discover the PLPMTU.
            This will result in the minimum configured PLPMTU (MIN_PLPMTU).
            More explanation of usage is provided in <xref target="examples" format="default"/>.
        </t>
	<aside>
        <t>Note: A receiver that only responds when there is a datagram
            queued for transmission by the Upper Layer could potentially
            receive multiple datagrams with a REQ Option before it can
            respond. When sent, the RES Option will only acknowledge the
            latest received token value. A sender would then conclude
            that any earlier REQ Options were not successfully received.
            However, DPLPMTUD does not usually result in sending more than one
            probe packet per timeout interval, and a delay in responding
            will already have been treated as a failed probe attempt.
            Therefore, this does not significantly impact performance,
            although a more prompt response would have resulted in
        DPLPMTUD recording reception of all probe packets.</t>

      <name>Examples with Different Receiver Behaviors</name>
      <t> When enabled, a DPLPMTUD endpoint that implements UDP Options
        normally responds with a
        UDP datagram with a RES Option when requested by a sender.</t>
      <t>The following examples describe various possible receiver behaviors:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>No DPLPMTUD receiver support:
            One case is when a sender supports this specification,
            but no RES Option is received from the remote endpoint.
            In this example, the method
            is unable to discover the PLPMTU. This will result in using the
            MIN_PLPMTU.
            Such a remote endpoint might be not configured to process UDP Options or
            might not return a datagram with a RES Option for some other reason
            (e.g., packet loss, insufficient space
            to include the option, filtering on the path, etc.).</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>DPLPMTUD receiver uses application datagrams:
            In a second case, both the sender and receiver
            support DPLPMTUD using the specification,
            and the receiver only returns a RES Option with the next UDP datagram
            that is sent to the requester.
            Therefore, reception of a REQ Option does not systematically trigger a response.
            This allows DPLPMTUD to operate when there is a flow of datagrams in both directions,
            provided there is periodic feedback (e.g., one acknowledgement packet per RTT).
            It requires the PLPMTU at the receiver
            to be sufficiently large enough that the RES Option can be included in the feedback packets
            that are sent in the return direction.
            This method avoids opportunities to misuse the method as a DoS attack.
            However, when there is a low
            rate of transmission (or no datagrams are sent) in the return direction,
            this will prevent prompt delivery of the RES Option.
            At the DPLPMTUD sender, this results in probe packets failing to be
            acknowledged in time
            and could result in a smaller PLPMTU than is actually supported by
            the path or in using the MIN_PLPMTU.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Unidirectional transfer: Another case is where an application only transfers data
            in one direction (or predominantly in one direction).
            In this case, the wait at the receiver for a datagram to be queued before
            returning a RES Option could easily result in a probe timeout
            at the DPLPMTUD sender.
            In this case, DPLPMTUD could allow exchanging datagrams without
            a payload (as discussed in earlier sections) to return the RES Option.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>DPLPMTUD receiver permitted to send responses in UDP datagrams with no payload:
            A DPLPMTUD receiver can generate a datagram (e.g., with zero payload data)
            solely to return a RES Option
            (e.g., sent when no other datagrams are queued for transmission).
            This would allow an endpoint to probe the set of UDP ports that have
            been configured with support for this specification
            using a DPLPMTUD probe packet.
            Although this results in some additional traffic overhead,
            it has the advantage that it
            can ensure timely progress of DPLPMTUD.
            <xref target="formats" format="default"/> specifies: "If a UDP Options endpoint creates and
            sends a datagram with a RES Option solely as response to a received REQ Option,
            the responder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> limit the rate of these responses
            (e.g., limiting each pair of ports to send 1 per measured RTT or 1 per second)".
            This rate limit is to mitigate the DoS vector, without significantly impacting
            the operation of DPLPMTUD.</t>

            to maliciously modify probe packets in an attempt to black-hole traffic.</t>
      <t>The specification recommends that the token value in the REQ Option is
            initialized to a randomized value. This is to enhance protection from off-path
            attacks.
            If a subsequent probe packet uses a token value that is easily derived
            from the initial value
            (e.g., incrementing the value), a misbehaving on-path observer could then
            determine the token values used for subsequent probe packets from
            that sender, even if these probe packets are not transiting via the observer.
            This would allow probe packets to be forged, with an impact similar to other on-path
            attacks against probe packets.
            This attack could be mitigated by using an unpredictable
            token value for each probe packet.</t>

            ICMP PTB message validation method described by DPLPMTUD: A UDP Options
            sender that utilizes ICMP PTB messages received to a probe packet <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
            use the quoted packet to validate the UDP port information in
            combination with the token contained in the UDP
            Option before processing the packet using the DPLPMTUD method.</t>
      <t>Upper Layer protocols or applications that employ encryption
            ought to perform DPLPMTUD
            at a layer above UDP Options and not enable UDP Options support for DPLPMTUD.
            This allows the application to control when DPLPMTUD is used to control the additional
            traffic that this generates.
            This also ensures that DPLPMTUD probe packets are encrypted.</t>
