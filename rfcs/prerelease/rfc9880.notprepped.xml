      <name>Introduction</name>
<t>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is concerned with Things,
namely physical objects that are available for interaction over a
network.
SDF is a format for domain experts to
use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models
that describe Things.
An SDF specification describes definitions of
SDF Objects/SDF Things and their associated interactions (Events, Actions,
and Properties), as well as the Data types for the information exchanged
in those interactions. Tools convert this format to database formats
and other serializations as needed.</t>
      <t>SDF is designed to be an extensible format.
The present document constitutes the base specification for SDF,
"base SDF" for short.
In addition, SDF extensions can be defined, some of which may make use
of extension points specifically defined for this in base SDF.
One area for such extensions would be refinements of SDF's abstract
interaction models into protocol bindings for specific ecosystems
(e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-mapping"/>).
For the use of certain other extensions, it may be necessary to
indicate in the SDF
document using them that a specific extension is in effect; see
<xref target="information-block"/> for details of the <tt>features</tt> quality that can be
used for such indications.
With extension points and feature indications available,
base SDF does not define a "version" concept for the SDF format itself
(as opposed to version indications within SDF documents indicating
their own evolution; see <xref target="information-block"/>).</t>

        <name>Structure of This Document</name>
        <t>After introductory material and an overview (<xref target="overview"/>) over the
elements of the model and the different kinds of names used,
<xref target="sdf-structure"/> introduces the main components of an SDF model.
<xref target="names-and-namespaces"/> revisits names and structures them into
namespaces.
<xref target="kw-defgroups"/> discusses the inner structure of the Objects defined by
SDF, the sdfObjects, in further detail.
<xref target="high-level-composition"/> discusses how SDF supports composition.
Conventional Sections (<xref format="title" target="iana"/>, <xref format="title" target="seccons"/>,
<xref format="title" target="sec-normative-references"/>, and <xref format="title" target="sec-informative-references"/>)
follow.
The normative <xref target="syntax"/> defines the syntax of SDF in
terms of its JSON structures, employing the Concise Data Definition
Language (CDDL) <xref target="RFC8610"/>.
This is followed by the informative <xref target="jso"/>, a rendition of the SDF
syntax in a "JSON Schema" format as they are defined by
<tt>json-schema.org</tt> (collectively called JSO).
The normative <xref target="jso-inspired"/> defines certain terms ("data qualities")
used at the SDF data model level that were inspired by JSO.
The informative <xref target="composition-examples"/> provides a few
examples for the use of composition in SDF.
Finally, <xref target="earlier"/> provides some historical information that can be
useful in upgrading earlier, pre-standard SDF models and
implementations to base SDF.</t>

            <dt>Element:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>A generic term used here in its English sense.
Exceptionally, in <xref target="jso-inspired"/>, the term is used explicitly in accordance with
its meaning in the JSON ecosystem, i.e., the elements of JSON
arrays.</t>

              <t>An otherwise very generic term that JavaScript (and thus JSON) uses
for the kind of maps that were part of the original languages from
the outset.
In this document, Object is used exclusively in its general English
meaning or as the colloquial shorthand for sdfObject, even if the

              <t>Certain environments use the term "property" for a JSON concept that
JSON calls "member" and is called "entry" here, or sometimes just for the
map key of these.
In this document, the term Property is specifically reserved for a
certain kind of Affordance, even if the map key "<tt>properties</tt>" is

Such an element becomes an Affordance when information is available
(directly or indirectly) that indicates how it can or should be
used.
In the present document, the term is used for the digital
(network-directed) interfaces of a Thing only; as it is a physical
object as well, the Thing might also have physical affordances such
as buttons, dials, and displays.
The specification language offers certain ways to create sets of
related Affordances and combine them into "Groupings" (see below).</t>

An SDF Model can be fully contained in a single SDF Document, or it
can be built from an SDF Document that references definitions and
declarations from additional SDF documents. The term SDF Specification can be used when the distinction between the distribution into individual SDF Documents and 
the abstract nature of the SDF Model is not of interest.

            <dd>
              <t>A metadata item in a definition or declaration that says something
about that definition or declaration.  A quality is represented in
SDF as an entry in a JSON map (JSON object) that serves as a definition
or declaration.

"Property", already has a different meaning.)</t>

            <dt>Definition:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>An entry in a Definition Group.
The entry creates a new semantic term for use in SDF models and
associates it with a set of qualities.
Unless the Class Name Keyword of the Group also makes it a
Declaration (see <xref target="definitions-block"/>), a definition just defines a
term and it does not create a component item within the enclosing
definition.</t>

            <dt>Declaration:</dt>
            <dd>

            <dd>
              <t>A Grouping where the declarations that it contains are for Affordances only (Property, Action, and Event declarations).
It serves as the main "atom" of reusable semantics for model
construction, representing the interaction model for a Thing that is
simple enough to not require a nested structure.
Therefore, sdfObjects are similar to sdfThings, but do not allow
nesting, i.e., they cannot contain other Groupings (sdfObjects or
sdfThings).</t>

            <dt>sdfThing:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>A Grouping that can contain nested Groupings (sdfThings and sdfObjects).
Like sdfObject, it can also contain Affordance
declarations (Property, Action, and Event declarations).
(Note that "Thing" has a different meaning from sdfThing and
is therefore not available as a colloquial shorthand of
sdfThing.)</t>

            <dt>Augmentation Mechanism:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>A companion document to a base SDF Model that provides additional
information ("augments" the base specification).
The information may be for use in
a specific ecosystem or with a specific protocol ("Protocol Binding").
No specific Augmentation Mechanisms are defined in base SDF.
A simple mechanism for such augmentations has been discussed as a
"mapping file" <xref target="I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-mapping"/>.</t>
            </dd>
            <dt>Protocol Binding:</dt>

          <t>The term "URI" in this document always refers to "full" URIs ("<tt>URI</tt>" in
Section <xref target="RFC3986" section="3" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 3986 <xref target="STD66"/>), never to relative URI references
("<tt>relative-ref</tt>" in Section <xref target="RFC3986" section="4.1" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 3986 <xref target="STD66"/>), so the term "URI"
does <em>NOT</em> serve as the colloquial abbreviation of "URI-Reference" it is
often used for.
Therefore, the "reference resolution" process defined in Section <xref target="RFC3986" section="5" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 3986 <xref target="STD66"/> is <em>NOT</em> used in this specification.
Where necessary, full URIs are assembled out of substrings by simple
concatenation, e.g., when CURIEs are expanded (<xref target="ref-global"/>) or when a
global name is formed out of a namespace <tt>absolute-URI</tt> (Section <xref target="RFC3986" section="5" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 3986 <xref target="STD66"/>) and a fragment identifier part (<xref target="names-structure"/>).
Also note that URIs are not only used to construct the SDF models,
they are also the <em>subject</em> of SDF models where they are used as data
in actual interactions (and could even be represented as relative
references there); these two usages are entirely separate.</t>
          <t>The singular form is chosen as the preferred one for the keywords

        <t>This is a model of a switch.
The state <tt>value</tt> declared in the <tt>sdfProperty</tt> group, represented by a Boolean, will be true for "on" and will be false for "off".
The Actions <tt>on</tt> or <tt>off</tt> declared in the <tt>sdfAction</tt> group are redundant with setting the <tt>value</tt> and are in the example to illustrate that there are often different ways of achieving the same effect.
The action <tt>toggle</tt> will invert the value of the sdfProperty value so that 2-way switches can be created; having such action will avoid the need for retrieving the current value first and then applying/setting the inverted value.</t>
        <t>The <tt>sdfObject</tt> group lists the affordances of Things modeled by this sdfObject.
The <tt>sdfProperty</tt> group lists the Property affordances described by the model; these represent various perspectives on the state of the sdfObject.
Properties can have additional qualities to describe the state more precisely.

Properties can be annotated to be read, write, or read/write; how this is actually done by the underlying transfer protocols is not described in the SDF model but left to companion protocol bindings.
Properties are often used with RESTful paradigms <xref target="I-D.irtf-t2trg-rest-iot"/> describing state.
The <tt>sdfAction</tt> group is the mechanism to describe other interactions in terms of their names, input, and output data (no data are used in the example), as in a POST method in REST or in a remote procedure call.
The example <tt>toggle</tt> is an Action that
changes the state based on the current state of the Property named <tt>value</tt>.
(The third type of affordance is Events, which are not described in this example.)</t>
        <t>In the JSON representation, the <tt>info</tt> group is an exception in that
this group's map has keys taken from the SDF vocabulary.
All other groups (such as <tt>namespace</tt> and <tt>sdfObject</tt>) have maps with
keys that are freely defined by the model writer (<tt>Switch</tt>, <tt>value</tt>,
<tt>on</tt>, etc.). These map keys are therefore called <em>Given Names</em>.
The groups made up of entries with Given Names as keys usually use the
<tt>named&lt;&gt;</tt> production in the formal syntax of SDF (<xref target="syntax"/>).
Where the values of these entries are maps, these again use SDF
vocabulary keys, and so on, generally alternating in further nesting.
The SDF-defined vocabulary items used in the hierarchy of such groups
are often, but not always, called <em>Quality Names</em> or <em>qualities</em>.
See <xref target="member-names"/> for more information about naming in SDF.</t>

        <t>The six main Class Name Keywords are discussed below.</t>
        <section anchor="sdfobject">
          <name>sdfObject</name>
          <t>sdfObjects, the items listed in an <tt>sdfObject</tt> definition group, are
the main "atom" of reusable semantics for model construction.
The concept aligns in scope with common definition items from many IoT modeling
systems, e.g., ZigBee Clusters <xref target="ZCL"/>, OMA SpecWorks LwM2M
Objects <xref target="OMA"/>, OCF Resource Types <xref target="OCF"/>, and W3C Web of Things Thing Descriptions <xref target="WoT"/>.</t>
          <t>An sdfObject definition contains a set of <tt>sdfProperty</tt>, <tt>sdfAction</tt>, and
<tt>sdfEvent</tt> definitions that describe the interaction affordances
associated with some scope of functionality.</t>
          <t>For the granularity of definition, sdfObject definitions are meant
to be kept narrow enough in scope to enable broad reuse and
interoperability.
For example, defining a light bulb using separate sdfObject
definitions for on/off control, dimming, and color control affordances
will enable interoperable functionality to be configured for diverse
product types.
An sdfObject definition for a common on/off control may be used to
control many different kinds of Things that require on/off control.</t>
          <t>The presence of one or both of the optional qualities "<tt>minItems</tt>" and
"<tt>maxItems</tt>" defines the sdfObject as an array, i.e., all the
affordances defined for the sdfObject exist a number of times, indexed
by a number constrained to be between <tt>minItems</tt> and <tt>maxItems</tt>,
inclusive, if given.
(Note: Setting "<tt>minItems</tt>" to zero and leaving out "<tt>maxItems</tt>" puts the
minimum constraints on that array.)</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sdfproperty">
          <name>sdfProperty</name>
          <t><tt>sdfProperty</tt> is used to model elements of state within Things modeled
by the enclosing grouping.</t>
          <t>A named definition entry in an sdfProperty may be associated with some protocol
affordance to enable the application to obtain the state variable and,
optionally, modify the state variable.
Additionally, some protocols provide for in-time reporting of state
changes.
(These three aspects are described by the qualities <tt>readable</tt>,
<tt>writable</tt>, and <tt>observable</tt> defined for an sdfProperty.)</t>
          <t>Definitions in <tt>sdfProperty</tt> groups look like the definitions in
<tt>sdfData</tt> groups.
However, they actually declare that a Property
with the given qualities potentially is present in the containing sdfObject.</t>
          <t>For definitions in <tt>sdfProperty</tt> and <tt>sdfData</tt>, SDF provides qualities
that can constrain the structure and values of data allowed in the
interactions modeled by them.
It also provides qualities that associate semantics to this
data, such as engineering units and unit scaling information.</t>
          <t>For the data definition within <tt>sdfProperty</tt> or <tt>sdfData</tt>, SDF borrows
some vocabulary proposed for drafts 4 <xref target="I-D.zyp-json-schema"/> <xref target="I-D.fge-json-schema-validation"/> and 7
<xref target="I-D.handrews-json-schema"/> <xref target="I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation"/> of the json-schema.org "JSON Schema" format
(collectively called JSO here), enhanced by qualities that are
specific to SDF.
Details about the JSO-inspired vocabulary are in <xref target="jso-inspired"/>.
For base SDF, data are constrained to be of
simple types (number, string, boolean),
JSON maps composed of named data, and arrays of these types.
Syntax extension points are provided that can be used to provide
richer types in a future extension of this specification (possibly more
of which can be borrowed from json-schema.org).</t>
          <t>Note that sdfProperty definitions (and sdfData definitions in
general) are not intended to constrain the formats of data used for
communication over network interfaces.
Where needed, data definitions for payloads of protocol messages are
expected to be part of the protocol binding.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sdfaction-overview">
          <name>sdfAction</name>
          <t>The <tt>sdfAction</tt> group contains declarations of Actions, which
model affordances that, when triggered,
have an effect that can go beyond just reading, updating, or observing Thing
state.
Actions often result in some outward physical effect (which, itself,
cannot be modeled in SDF).  From a programmer's perspective, they
might be considered to be roughly analogous to method calls.</t>
          <t>Actions may have data parameters; these are each modeled as a single item of input
data and output data.  Where multiple parameters need to be
modeled, an "<tt>object</tt>" type can be used to combine these parameters
into one; for an example, see <xref target="example-obj-type"/> in <xref target="type-object"/>.</t>
          <t>Actions may be long-running, that is to say that the effects may not
take place immediately as would be expected for an update to an
sdfProperty; the effects may play out over time and emit action
results.
Actions may also not always complete and may result in application
errors, such as an item blocking the closing of an automatic door.</t>
          <t>One idiom for giving an action initiator status and control about the
ongoing action is to provide a URI for an ephemeral "action resource"
in the sdfAction output data, allowing the action to deliver
immediate feedback (including errors that prevent the action from
starting) and the action initiator to use the action resource
for further observation or modification of the ongoing action
(including canceling it).
Base SDF does not provide any tailored support for describing such
action resources; an extension for modeling links in more detail
(for instance, <xref target="I-D.ietf-asdf-sdftype-link"/>) may be all that is needed to fully enable modeling
them.</t>
          <t>Actions may have (or lack) the characteristics of idempotence and side-effect
safety (see Section <xref target="RFC9110" section="9.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 9110 <xref target="STD97"/> for more on these terms).</t>
          <t>Base SDF only provides data constraint modeling and semantics for the input and output data of definitions in <tt>sdfAction</tt> groups.
Again, data definitions for payloads of protocol messages, and
detailed protocol settings for invoking the action, are expected to be
part of the protocol binding.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sdfevent-overview">
          <name>sdfEvent</name>
          <t>The <tt>sdfEvent</tt> group contains declarations of Events, which model
affordances that inform about "happenings" associated with a Thing
modeled by the enclosing sdfObject; these may result in a signal being
stored or emitted as a result.</t>
          <t>Note that there is a trivial overlap with sdfProperty state changes,
which may also be defined as Events but are not generally required to
be defined as such.
However, Events may exhibit certain ordering, consistency, and
reliability requirements that are expected to be supported in various
implementations of sdfEvent that do distinguish sdfEvent from
sdfProperty.
For instance, while a state change may simply be superseded by another
state change, some Events are "precious" and need to be preserved even
if further Events follow.</t>
          <t>Base SDF only provides data constraint modeling and
semantics for the output data of Event affordances.
Again, data definitions for payloads of protocol messages, and
detailed protocol settings for soliciting the event, are expected to be
part of the protocol binding.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sdfdata">
          <name>sdfData</name>
          <t>Definitions in <tt>sdfData</tt> groups do not themselves specify affordances.
These definitions
are provided separately from those in
sdfProperty groups to enable common
modeling patterns, data constraints, and semantic anchor concepts to
be factored out for data items that make up sdfProperty items and
serve as input and output data for sdfAction and sdfEvent items.
The data types defined in sdfData definitions only spring to life by being referenced in
one of these contexts (directly or indirectly via some other sdfData
definitions).</t>
          <t>It is a common use case for such a data definition to be shared
between an sdfProperty item and input or output parameters of an
sdfAction or output data provided by an sdfEvent.
sdfData definitions also enable factoring out extended application
data types, such as mode and machine state enumerations to be reused
across multiple definitions that have similar basic characteristics
and requirements.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sdfthing">
          <name>sdfThing</name>
          <t>Back at the top level, the <tt>sdfThing</tt> group enables definition of models for
complex devices that will use one or more sdfObject definitions.
Like sdfObject, sdfThing groups allow for the inclusion of interaction
affordances, sdfData, as well as "<tt>minItems</tt>" and "<tt>maxItems</tt>" qualities.
Therefore, they can be seen as a superset of sdfObject groups, additionally
allowing for composition.</t>
          <t>As a result, an sdfThing directly or indirectly contains a set of sdfProperty, sdfAction, and
sdfEvent definitions that describe the interaction affordances
associated with some scope of functionality.</t>
          <t>A definition in an sdfThing group can refine the metadata of the definitions it
is composed of: other definitions in sdfThing groups or definitions in sdfObject groups.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="member-names">
        <name>Member Names: Given Names and Quality Names</name>
        <t>SDF documents are JSON maps that mostly employ JSON maps as
member values, which in turn mostly employ JSON maps as their
member values, and so on.
This nested structure of JSON maps creates a tree, where the edges
are the member names (map keys) used in these JSON maps.
(In certain cases, where member names are not needed, JSON arrays may
be interspersed in this tree.)</t>
        <section anchor="given-names-and-quality-names">
          <name>Given Names and Quality Names</name>
          <t>For any particular JSON map in an SDF document, the set of member
names that are used is either:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>A set of "<em>Quality Names</em>", where the entries in the map are
Qualities.  Quality Names are defined by the present specification
and its extensions, together with specific semantics to be
associated with the member value given with a certain Quality Name.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>A set of "<em>Given Names</em>", where the entries in the map are separate
entities (definitions, declarations, etc.) that each have names that
are chosen by the SDF document author in order that these names can be
employed by a user of that model.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>In a path from the root of the tree to any leaf, Quality Names and
Given Names roughly alternate (with the information block,
<xref target="information-block"/>, as a prominent exception).</t>
          <t>The meaning of the JSON map that is the member value associated
with a Given Name is derived from the Quality Name that was used as
the member name associated to the parent.
In the CDDL grammar given in <xref target="syntax"/>, JSON maps with member names that are
Given Names are defined using the CDDL generic rule reference <tt>named&lt;membervalues&gt;</tt>,
where <tt>membervalues</tt> is in turn the structure of the member values of the
JSON map, i.e., the value of the member named by the Given Name.
As quality-named maps and given-named maps roughly alternate in
a path down the tree, <tt>membervalues</tt> is usually a map built from
Quality Names as keys.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="hierarchical-names">
          <name>Hierarchical Names</name>
          <t>From the outside of a specification, Given Names are usually used as
part of a hierarchical name that looks like a JSON Pointer <xref target="RFC6901"/>.
These hierarchical names are
generally rooted in (used as the fragment identifier in) an
outer namespace that looks like an <tt>https://</tt> URL (see <xref target="names-and-namespaces"/>).</t>
          <t>As Quality Names and Given Names roughly alternate in a path into the
model, the JSON Pointer part of the hierarchical name also alternates
between Quality Names and Given Names.</t>
          <t>Note that the actual Given Names may need to be encoded when specified
via the JSON Pointer fragment identifier syntax. There are
two layers of such encoding: tilde encoding of <tt>~</tt> and <tt>/</tt> as per
<xref section="3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC6901"/>, as well as percent encoding of the
tilde-encoded name into a valid URI fragment as per <xref section="6" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC6901"/>.
For example, when a model is using the Given Name</t>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
   warning/danger alarm
]]></artwork>
          <t>(with an embedded slash and a space) for an
sdfObject, that sdfObject may need to be referenced as</t>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
   #/sdfObject/warning~1danger%20alarm
]]></artwork>
          <t>To sidestep potential interoperability problems, it is probably wise
to avoid characters in Given Names that need such encoding (Quality
Names are already defined in such a way that they never do).</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="gnqn">
          <name>Extensibility of Given Names and Quality Names</name>
          <t>In SDF, both Quality Names and Given Names are <em>extension points</em>.
This is more obvious for Quality Names. Extending SDF is mostly done
by defining additional qualities.  To enable non-conflicting third
party extensions to SDF, qualified names (names with an embedded
colon) can be used as Quality Names.</t>
          <t>A nonqualified Quality Name is composed of ASCII letters, digits, and
<tt>$</tt> signs, starting with a lowercase letter or a <tt>$</tt> sign (i.e.,
using a pattern of "<tt>[a-z$][A-Za-z$0-9]*</tt>").
Names with <tt>$</tt> signs are intended to be used for functions separate
from most other names; for instance, <tt>$comment</tt>
is used for the comment quality in this specification (the presence or absence of a
<tt>$comment</tt> quality does not change the meaning of the SDF model).
Names that are composed of multiple English words can use the
"lowerCamelCase" convention <xref target="CamelCase"/> for indicating the word
boundaries; no other use is intended for upper case letters in Quality
Names.</t>
          <t>A qualified Quality Name is composed of a Quality Name Prefix, a <tt>:</tt>
(colon) character, and a nonqualified Quality Name.
Quality Name Prefixes are registered in the "Quality Name Prefixes"
registry in the "Semantic Definition Format (SDF)" registry group (<xref target="qnp"/>).
They are
composed of lowercase ASCII letters and digits, starting with a lowercase ASCII letter (i.e., using a pattern of "<tt>[a-z][a-z0-9]*</tt>").</t>
          <t>Given Names are not restricted by the formal SDF syntax.
To enable non-surprising name translations in tools, combinations of
ASCII alphanumeric characters and <tt>-</tt> (ASCII hyphen/minus) are preferred,
typically employing kebab-case for names constructed out of multiple
words <xref target="KebabCase"/>.  ASCII hyphen/minus can then unambiguously be
translated to an ASCII <tt>_</tt> underscore character and back depending on
the programming environment.
Some styles also allow a dot ("<tt>.</tt>") in Given Names.
Given Names are often sufficiently self-explanatory that they can be
used in place of the <tt>label</tt> quality if that is not given.
In turn, if a Given Name turns out too complicated, a more elaborate
<tt>label</tt> can be given and the Given Name kept simple.
As Given Names are "programmers' names", base SDF does not address
internationalization of Given Names.
(More likely qualities to receive localizable equivalents by
exercising the Quality Name extension point are <tt>label</tt> and
<tt>description</tt>).</t>
          <t>Further, to enable Given Names to have a more powerful role in building
global hierarchical names, an extension is foreseen that makes use of
qualified names for Given Names.
So, until that extension is defined, Given Names with one or more
embedded colons are reserved and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used in an SDF document.</t>
          <t>All names in SDF are case-sensitive.</t>

      <t>SDF definitions are contained in SDF documents together with data
about the SDF document itself (information block).
Definitions and declarations from additional SDF documents can be
referenced; together with the definitions and declarations in the

      <t>Each SDF document is represented as a single JSON map.
This map can be thought of as having three blocks: the information
block, the namespaces block, and the definitions block.
These blocks contain zero or more JSON name/value pairs, the names of
which are Quality Names and the values of which mostly are (nested)
maps (the exception defined in base SDF is the defaultNamespace
quality, the value of which is a text string).
An empty nested map of this kind is equivalent to not having the
quality included at all.</t>

        <t>The information block contains generic metadata for the SDF document
itself and all included definitions.
To enable tool integration, the information block is optional in the grammar
of SDF; most processes for working with SDF documents will have policies
that only SDF documents with an info block can be processed.
It is therefore <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that SDF validator tools emit a warning

        <t>The version quality is used to indicate version information about the
set of definitions in the SDF document.
The version is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to be lexicographically increasing over the life of a model; a newer model always has a version string that string-compares higher than all previous versions.

This is easily achieved by following the convention to start the version with a <tt>date-time</tt> as defined in <xref target="RFC3339"/> or, if new versions are generated less frequently than once a day, just the <tt>full-date</tt> (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD); in many cases, that will be all that is needed (see <xref target="example1"/> for an example).
   This specification does not give a strict definition for the format of the
   version string, but each system or organization using the version string
   should define internal structure and semantics to the level needed for
   their use.  If no further details are provided, a <tt>date-time</tt> or
   <tt>full-date</tt> in this field can be assumed to indicate the latest
   update time of the definitions in the SDF document.</t>
        <t>The modified quality can be used with a value using <tt>date-time</tt> as defined in <xref target="RFC3339"/> (with <tt>Z</tt> for time-zone) or <tt>full-date</tt> format to express time of the latest revision of the definitions.</t>
        <t>The license string is preferably either a URI that points to a web page with an unambiguous definition of the license or an <xref target="SPDX"/> license identifier.
(As an example, for models to be handled by the One Data Model liaison
group, this license identifier will typically be "BSD-3-Clause".)</t>
        <t>The <tt>features</tt> quality can be used to list names of critical (i.e., cannot be safely ignored) SDF extension features that need to be understood for the definitions to be properly processed.
Extension feature names will be specified in extension documents.
They can either be registered (see <xref target="fn"/> for specifics, which make sure
that a registered feature name does not contain a colon) or be a URI
(which always contain a colon).
Note that SDF processors are not expected to, and normally <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>,
dereference URIs used as feature names; any representation retrievable
under such a URI could be useful to humans, though.

identifiers).</t>

        <t>The following example declares a set of namespaces and defines <tt>cap</tt>

By convention, the values in the namespace map contain full URIs

added, if needed, where the namespace entry is used.</t>

        <t>Multiple SDF documents can contribute to the same namespace by using

        <t>If no defaultNamespace setting is given, the SDF document does not
contribute to a global namespace (all definitions remain local to the
model and are not accessible for re-use by other models).
As the defaultNamespace is set by supplying a
namespace short name, its presence requires a namespace map that contains a
mapping for that namespace short name.</t>
        <t>If no namespace map is given, no short names for namespace URIs are
set up and no defaultNamespace can be given.</t>

        <name>Definitions Block</name>
        <t>The Definitions block contains one or more groups, each identified by
a Class Name Keyword such as <tt>sdfObject</tt> or <tt>sdfProperty</tt>.
There can only be one group per keyword at this level; putting all the
individual definitions in the group under that keyword is just a
shortcut for identifying the class name keyword that applies to each
of them without repeating it for each definition.</t>
        <t>The value of each group is a JSON map, the keys of which serve for naming the individual definitions in this group, and the corresponding values provide a set of qualities (name-value pairs) for the individual definition.
(In short, these map entries are also termed "named sets of qualities".)</t>
        <t>Each group may contain zero or more definitions.
Each identifier defined creates a new type and term in the target namespace.
Declarations have a scope of the definition block they are
directly contained in.</t>
        <t>In turn, a definition may contain other definitions. Each definition is a named set of qualities, i.e., it consists of the newly defined identifier and a set of key-value pairs that represent the defined qualities and contained definitions.</t>
        <t>An example for an sdfObject definition is given in <xref target="exobject"/>:</t>

        <t>This example defines an sdfObject "foo" that is defined in the default namespace (full address: <tt>#/sdfObject/foo</tt>), containing a Property that can be addressed as
<tt>#/sdfObject/foo/sdfProperty/bar</tt>, with data of type boolean.</t>
        <t>Often, definitions are also declarations. The definition of the
entry "bar" in the Property "foo" means that data corresponding to the
"foo" Property in a Property interaction offered by Thing can have zero or
one components modeled by "bar".
Entries within <tt>sdfProperty</tt>, <tt>sdfAction</tt>, and <tt>sdfEvent</tt> that are in
turn within <tt>sdfObject</tt> or <tt>sdfThing</tt> entries, are also declarations;
entries within <tt>sdfData</tt> are not.
Similarly, <tt>sdfObject</tt> or <tt>sdfThing</tt> entries within an sdfThing
definition specify that the

interactions modeled by the nested <tt>sdfObject</tt> or <tt>sdfThing</tt>.</t>

As there is little point in referencing the entire SDF document, this will be a <tt>#</tt> followed by a JSON Pointer.
This is the only kind of name reference to itself that is possible in an SDF

        <t>In a JSON map establishing a definition, the keyword <tt>sdfRef</tt> is used

definition, indicated by the included name reference, into the newly
formed definition.
(This can be compared to the processing of the <tt>$ref</tt> keyword in <xref target="I-D.handrews-json-schema"/>.)
The referenced definition should be such that, after copying and
applying the additional qualities in the referencing definition, the
newly built definition is also valid SDF (e.g., the copied qualities
and definitions are valid in the context of the new definition).</t>
        <t>For example, this reference:</t>
        <sourcecode type="sdf+json"><![CDATA[
"temperatureProperty": {
  "sdfRef": "#/sdfData/temperatureData"
}
]]></sourcecode>
        <t>creates a new definition "temperatureProperty" that contains all of the qualities defined in the definition at /sdfData/temperatureData.</t>
        <t>The sdfRef member need not be the only member of a map.
Additional members may be present with the intention of overriding parts
of the referenced map or adding new qualities or definitions.</t>
        <t>When processing sdfRef, if the target definition contains also sdfRef (i.e., is based on yet another definition), that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be processed as well.</t>
        <t>More formally, for a JSON map that contains an
sdfRef member, the semantics are defined to be as if the following steps were performed:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
            <t>The JSON map that contains the sdfRef member is copied into a
variable named "patch".</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The sdfRef member of the copy in "patch" is removed.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The JSON Pointer that is the value of the sdfRef member is
dereferenced and the result is copied into a variable named "original".</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The JSON Merge Patch algorithm <xref target="RFC7396"/> is applied to patch
the contents of "original" with the contents of "patch".</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The result of the Merge Patch is used in place of the value of the
original JSON map.</t>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <t>Note that the formal syntaxes given in Appendices <xref format="counter" target="syntax"/> and <xref format="counter" target="jso"/>
generally describe the <em>result</em> of applying a merge-patch. The notations
are not powerful enough to describe, for instance, how the merge-patch
algorithm causes null values within the sdfRef to remove members of JSON
maps from the referenced target.
Nonetheless, the syntaxes also give the syntax
of the sdfRef itself, which vanishes during the resolution; therefore, in many
cases, even merge-patch inputs will validate with these
formal syntaxes.</t>
        <t>Given the example (<xref target="example1"/>) and the following definition:</t>

        <t>The keyword <tt>sdfRequired</tt> is provided to apply a constraint that
defines for which declarations the corresponding data are mandatory in a
grouping (sdfThing or sdfObject) modeled by the current definition.</t>
        <t>The value of <tt>sdfRequired</tt> is an array of references, each indicating
one or more declarations that are mandatory to be represented.</t>
        <t>References in this array can be SDF names (JSON Pointers) or one of
two abbreviated reference formats:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>A text string with a "referenceable-name", namely an affordance name
or a grouping name:  </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
                <t>All affordance declarations that are directly in the same grouping
(i.e., not nested further in another grouping) and that carry this
name are declared to be mandatory to be represented.
Note that there can be multiple such affordance declarations, one
per affordance type.</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>The same applies to groupings made mandatory within groupings
containing them.</t>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The Boolean value <tt>true</tt>.
The affordance or grouping itself that carries the <tt>sdfRequired</tt>
keyword is declared to be mandatory to be represented.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>Note that referenceable-names are not
subject to the encoding JSON Pointers require as discussed in <xref target="hierarchical-names"/>.
To ensure that referenceable-names are reliably distinguished from JSON Pointers,
they are defined such that they cannot contain ":" or
"#" characters (see rule <tt>referenceable-name</tt> in <xref target="syntax"/>).
(If these characters are indeed contained in a Given Name, a JSON
Pointer needs to be formed instead in order to reference it in "sdfRequired",
potentially requiring further path elements as well as JSON Pointer
encoding.  The need for this is best avoided by choosing Given Names
without these characters.)</t>
        <t>The example in <xref target="example-req"/> shows two required elements in the sdfObject definition for "temperatureWithAlarm", the sdfProperty "currentTemperature", and the sdfEvent "overTemperatureEvent". The example also shows the use of JSON Pointers with "sdfRef" to use a pre-existing definition for the sdfProperty "currentTemperature" and 
for the sdfOutputData produced by the sdfEvent "overTemperatureEvent".</t>

is a text string from a set of type names defined by the  "sdfType
values" registry in the "Semantic Definition Format (SDF)" registry group
(<xref target="sdftype-values"/>).
The sdfType name is composed of lowercase ASCII letters, digits,
and <tt>-</tt> (ASCII hyphen/minus) characters, starting
with a lowercase ASCII letter (i.e., using a pattern of
"⁠<tt>[a-z][-a-z0-9]*</tt>") and typically employing kebab-case for
names constructed out of multiple words <xref target="KebabCase"/>.</t>

to the definitions in the SDF documents in that namespace.
For example, if there is an SDF document defining an sdfObject "<tt>Switch</tt>"

"<tt>ns:#/sdfObject/Switch/sdfAction/on</tt>", where <tt>ns</tt> is the namespace prefix

          <name>Use of the "sdfRef" Keyword to Reuse a Definition</name>
          <t>An existing definition may be used as a template for a new definition, that is, a new definition is created in the target namespace that uses the defined qualities of some existing definition.
This pattern uses the keyword <tt>sdfRef</tt> as a quality of a new definition with a value consisting of a reference to the existing definition that is to be used as a template.</t>
          <t>In the definition that uses <tt>sdfRef</tt>, new qualities may be added
and existing qualities from the referenced definition may be
overridden.  (Note that JSON maps do not have a defined
order, so the SDF processor may see these overrides before seeing the
<tt>sdfRef</tt>.)</t>
          <t>Note that the definition referenced by <tt>sdfRef</tt> might contain
qualities or definitions that are not valid in the context where the
<tt>sdfRef</tt> is used.
In this case, the resulting model, when resolved, may be invalid.
Example: an sdfRef adds an sdfThing definition in an sdfObject
definition.</t>
          <t>As a convention, overrides are intended to be used only for further
restricting the allowable set of data values.
Such a usage is shown in <xref target="exa-sdfref"/>:  any value allowable for a
<tt>cable-length</tt> is also an allowable value for a <tt>length</tt>, with the
additional restriction that the length cannot be smaller than 5 cm.
(This is labeled as a convention as it cannot be checked in the
general case.
A quality of implementation consideration for a tool
might be to provide at least some form of checking.)
Note that the example provides a <tt>description</tt> that overrides the
<tt>description</tt> of the referenced definition; as this quality is
intended for human consumption, there is no conflict with the intended
goal.</t>

        <name>sdfThing</name>
        <t>An sdfThing is a set of declarations and qualities that may be part of
a more complex model.
For example, the sdfObject declarations that make
up the definition of a single socket of an outlet strip could be
encapsulated in an sdfThing, which itself could be used in a declaration in the sdfThing definition for the outlet strip.
(See <xref target="exa-sdfthing-outlet-strip"/> in <xref target="outlet-strip-example"/> for parts
of an SDF model for this example.)</t>
        <t>sdfThing definitions carry semantic meaning, such as a defined refrigerator compartment and a defined freezer compartment, making up a combination refrigerator-freezer product.
An sdfThing may be composed of sdfObjects and other sdfThings.
It can also contain sdfData definitions, as well as declarations of interaction affordances itself, such
as a status (on/off) for the refrigerator-freezer as a whole (see
<xref target="exa-sdfthing-fridge-freezer"/> in <xref target="fridge-freezer-example"/> for an example SDF
model illustrating these aspects).</t>
        <t>The qualities of sdfThing are shown in <xref target="sdfthingqual"/>.
None of these qualities are required or have default values that are assumed if the quality is absent. Analogous to sdfObject, the presence of one or both of the optional
qualities "<tt>minItems</tt>" and "<tt>maxItems</tt>" defines the sdfThing as an
array.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Some wider security considerations applicable to Things are discussed
in <xref target="RFC8576"/>.</t>
      <t><xref section="5" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8610"/> gives an overview over security considerations
that arise when formal description techniques are used to govern
interoperability; analogs of these security considerations can apply
to SDF.</t>
      <t>The security considerations of underlying building blocks such as
those detailed in Section <xref target="RFC3629" section="10" sectionFormat="bare"/> of RFC 3629 <xref target="STD63"/> apply.</t>
      <t>SDF uses JSON as a representation language.
For a number of
cases, <xref target="STD90"/> indicates that implementation behavior for certain constructs
allowed by the JSON grammar is unpredictable.</t>
      <t>Implementations need to be robust against invalid or unpredictable
cases on input, preferably by rejecting input that is invalid or
that would lead to unpredictable behavior, and avoid generating
these cases on output.</t>
      <t>Implementations of model languages may also exhibit
performance-related availability issues when the attacker can control
the input, see <xref section="4.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9535"/> for a brief discussion and
<xref section="8" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9485"/> for considerations specific to the use
of <tt>pattern</tt>.</t>
<t>SDF may be used in two processes that are often security relevant: (1) model-based <em>validation</em> of data that is intended to be described by SDF models, and (2) model-based <em>augmentation</em> of these data with information obtained from the SDF models that apply.</t>
      <t>Implementations need to ascertain the provenance (and thus
authenticity and integrity) and applicability of
the SDF models they employ operationally in such security-relevant ways.
Implementations that make use of the composition mechanisms defined in this
document need to do this for each of the components they combine
into the SDF models they employ.
Essentially, this process needs to undergo the same care and scrutiny
as any other introduction of source code into a build environment; the
possibility of supply-chain attacks on the modules imported needs to
be considered.</t>
      <t>Specifically, implementations might rely on model-based input
validation for enforcing certain characteristics of the data structure
ingested (which, if not validated, could lead to malfunctions such as
crashes and remote code execution).
These implementations need to be particularly careful
about the data models they apply, including their provenance and
potential changes of these characteristics that upgrades to the referenced
modules may (inadvertently or as part of an attack) cause.
More generally speaking, implementations should strive to be robust
against expected and unexpected limitations of the model-based input
validation mechanisms and their implementations.</t>
      <t>Similarly, implementations that rely on model-based augmentation may
generate false data from their inputs; this is an integrity violation
in any case, but also can possibly be exploited for further attacks.</t>
      <t>In applications that dynamically acquire models and obtain modules
from module references in these models, the security considerations of
dereferenceable identifiers apply (see <xref target="I-D.bormann-t2trg-deref-id"/> for a more extensive
discussion of dereferenceable identifiers).</t>
      <t>There may be confidentiality requirements on SDF models, both on their
content and on the fact that a specific model is used in a particular
Thing or environment.
The present specification does not discuss model discovery or define
an access control model for SDF models, nor does it define a way to
obtain selective disclosure where that may be required.
It is likely that these definitions require additional context from
underlying ecosystems and the characteristics of the protocols
employed there; therefore, this is left as future work (e.g., for
documents such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-mapping"/>).</t>

      <t>This normative appendix describes the syntax of SDF using CDDL <xref target="RFC8610"/>.</t>
      <t>This appendix shows the framework syntax only, i.e., a syntax with liberal extension points.
Since this syntax is nearly useless in finding typos in an SDF
specification, a second syntax, the validation syntax, is defined that
does not include the extension points.
The validation syntax can be generated from the framework syntax by
leaving out all lines containing the string <tt>EXTENSION-POINT</tt>; as this
is trivial, the result is not shown here.</t>
      <t>This appendix makes use of CDDL "features" as defined in <xref section="4" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9165"/>.
Features whose names end in "-ext" indicate extension points for
further evolution.</t>

      <t>This informative appendix describes the syntax of SDF defined in <xref target="syntax"/>, but
uses a version of the description techniques advertised on
json-schema.org <xref target="I-D.handrews-json-schema"/> <xref target="I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation"/>.</t>
      <t>The appendix shows both the validation and the framework syntax.
Since most of the lines are the same between these two files, those lines are shown only once, with a leading space, in the form of a unified diff.
Lines leading with a <tt>-</tt> are part of the validation syntax and lines leading with a <tt>+</tt> are part of the framework syntax.</t>

      <name>Data Qualities Inspired by json-schema.org</name>
      <t>This appendix is normative.</t>
      <t>Data qualities define data used in SDF affordances at an information
model level.
A popular way to describe JSON data at a data model level is proposed
by a number of drafts on json-schema.org (which collectively are
abbreviated JSO here); for reference to a popular version, this appendix
points to <xref target="I-D.handrews-json-schema"/> and <xref target="I-D.handrews-json-schema-validation"/>.
As the vocabulary used by JSO is familiar to many JSON modelers, the
present specification borrows some of the terms and ports their
semantics to the information model level needed for SDF.</t>
      <t>The main data quality imported is the "<tt>type</tt>".
In SDF, this can take one of six (text string) values, which are
discussed in the following subsections (note that the JSO type
"<tt>null</tt>" is not supported as a value of this data quality in SDF).</t>
      <t>The additional quality "<tt>const</tt>" restricts the data to one specific
value (given as the value of the <tt>const</tt> quality).</t>
      <t>Similarly, the additional quality "<tt>default</tt>" provides data that can
be used in the absence of the data (given as the value of the <tt>default</tt>
quality); this is mainly documentary and not very well-defined for SDF
as no process is defined that would add default values to an instance
of some interaction data.</t>
      <t>Other qualities that are inspired by JSO are "<tt>$comment</tt>" and
"<tt>description</tt>", both of which are also available in the information block.</t>
      <section anchor="type-number-type-integer">
        <name>type "<tt>number</tt>", type "<tt>integer</tt>"</name>
        <t>The types "<tt>number</tt>" and "<tt>integer</tt>" are associated with floating point
and integer numbers, as they are available in JSON.
A type value of <tt>integer</tt> means that only integer values of JSON
numbers can be used (note that <tt>10.0</tt> is an integer value, even if it
is in a notation that would also allow non-zero decimal fractions).</t>
        <t>The additional data qualities "<tt>minimum</tt>", "<tt>maximum</tt>",
"<tt>exclusiveMinimum</tt>", and "<tt>exclusiveMaximum</tt>" provide number values that
serve as inclusive/exclusive lower/upper bounds for the number.
(Note that the Boolean form of
"<tt>exclusiveMinimum</tt>"/"<tt>exclusiveMaximum</tt>" found in earlier JSO drafts <xref target="I-D.fge-json-schema-validation"/>
is not used.)</t>
        <t>The data quality "<tt>multipleOf</tt>" gives a positive number that
constrains the data value to be an integer multiple of the number
given.
(Type "<tt>integer</tt>" can also be expressed as a "<tt>multipleOf</tt>" quality of
value 1, unless another "<tt>multipleOf</tt>" quality is present.)</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="type-string">
        <name>type "<tt>string</tt>"</name>
        <t>The type "<tt>string</tt>" is associated with Unicode text string values, as
they can be represented in JSON.</t>
        <t>The length (as measured in characters, specifically Unicode scalar
values) can be constrained by the
additional data qualities "<tt>minLength</tt>" and "<tt>maxLength</tt>", which are
inclusive bounds.</t>
        <t>(More specifically, Unicode text strings as defined in this
specification are sequences of Unicode scalar values, the number of
which is taken as the length of such a text string.</t>
        <t>The data quality "<tt>pattern</tt>" takes a string value that is interpreted
as an <xref target="ECMA-262"/> regular expression in Unicode mode that constrains the
string (note that these are not anchored by default, so unless <tt>^</tt> and
<tt>$</tt> anchors are employed, ECMA-262 regular expressions match any string that <em>contains</em> a match).
The JSO proposals acknowledge that regular expression support is
rather diverse in various platforms, so the suggestion is to limit
them to:</t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
          <li>
            <t>characters;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>character classes in square brackets, including ranges; their complements;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>simple quantifiers <tt>*</tt>, <tt>+</tt>, <tt>?</tt>, and range quantifiers <tt>{n}</tt>,
<tt>{n,m}</tt>, and <tt>{n,}</tt>;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>grouping parentheses;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>the choice operator <tt>|</tt>;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>and anchors (beginning-of-input <tt>^</tt> and end-of-input <tt>$</tt>).</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>Note that this subset is somewhat similar to the subset introduced by
I-Regexps <xref target="RFC9485"/>, which  are anchored
regular expressions and include certain backslash escapes for
characters and character classes.</t>
        <t>The additional data quality "<tt>format</tt>" can take one of the following
values.  Note that, at an information model level, the presence of
this data quality changes the type from being a simple text string to
the abstract meaning of the format given (i.e., the format "date-time"
is less about the specific syntax employed in <xref target="RFC3339"/> than about the usage
as an absolute point in civil time).</t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
          <li>
            <t>"<tt>date-time</tt>", "<tt>date</tt>", "<tt>time</tt>":
A <tt>date-time</tt>, <tt>full-date</tt>, or <tt>full-time</tt> as defined in <xref target="RFC3339"/>, respectively.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>"<tt>uri</tt>", "<tt>uri-reference</tt>":
A  URI or URI Reference as defined in <xref target="STD66"/>, respectively.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>"<tt>uuid</tt>": A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) as defined in <xref target="RFC9562"/>).</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="type-boolean">
        <name>type "<tt>boolean</tt>"</name>
        <t>The type "<tt>boolean</tt>" can take the values "<tt>true</tt>" or "<tt>false</tt>".</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="type-array">
        <name>type "<tt>array</tt>"</name>
        <t>The type "<tt>array</tt>" is associated with arrays, as they are available in
JSON.</t>
        <t>The additional quality "<tt>items</tt>" gives the type that each of the
elements of the array must match.</t>
        <t>The number of elements in the array can be constrained by the additional
data qualities "<tt>minItems</tt>" and "<tt>maxItems</tt>", which are inclusive
bounds.</t>
        <t>The additional data quality "<tt>uniqueItems</tt>" gives a Boolean value
that, if true, requires the elements to be all different.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="type-object">
        <name>type "<tt>object</tt>"</name>
        <t>The type "<tt>object</tt>" is associated with maps, from strings to values, as
they are available in JSON.</t>
        <t>The additional quality "<tt>properties</tt>" is a map the entries of which
describe entries in the specified JSON map: the key gives an
allowable map key for the specified JSON map and the value is a
map with a named set of data qualities giving the type for the
corresponding value in the specified JSON map.</t>
        <t>All entries specified in this way are optional unless they are listed in
the value of the additional quality "<tt>required</tt>", which is an array of
string values that give the key names of required entries.</t>
        <t>Note that the term "properties" as an additional quality for
defining map entries is unrelated to sdfProperty.</t>
        <t>For example, to include information about the type of the event in the
"overTemperatureEvent" of <xref target="example-req"/>, the sdfOutputData there could
be defined as follows:</t>
        <figure anchor="example-obj-type">
          <name>Using Object Type with sdfOutputData</name>
          <sourcecode type="sdf+json"><![CDATA[

      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "alarmType": {

        },
        "temperature": {
"sdfRef": "#/sdfObject/temperatureWithAlarm/sdfData/temperatureData"
        }
      }
    }
]]></sourcecode>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section anchor="implementation-notes">
        <name>Implementation Notes</name>
        <t>JSO-based keywords are also used in the specification techniques of a
number of ecosystems, but some adjustments may be required.</t>
        <t>For instance, <xref target="OCF"/> is based on Swagger 2.0, which appears to be based on
"draft-4" <xref target="I-D.zyp-json-schema"/> <xref target="I-D.fge-json-schema-validation"/> (also called draft-5, but semantically intended to
be equivalent to draft-4).
The "<tt>exclusiveMinimum</tt>" and "<tt>exclusiveMaximum</tt>" keywords use the
Boolean form there, so on import to SDF, their values have to be
replaced by the values of the respective "<tt>minimum</tt>"/"<tt>maximum</tt>"
keyword, which are then removed; the reverse transformation
applies on export.</t>

      <name>Some Changes from Earlier Draft Versions of this Specification</name>
      <t>This appendix is informative.</t>
      <t>The present document provides the base SDF definition.
Previous revisions of SDF, as defined in earlier drafts of this specification, have been in use
for several years; both significant collections of older SDF models and older SDF
conversion tools are available today.
This appendix provides a brief checklist that can aid in upgrading
these to the standard.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>The quality <tt>unit</tt> was previously called <tt>units</tt>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t><tt>sdfType</tt> was developed out of a concept previously called <tt>subtype</tt>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t><tt>sdfChoice</tt> is the preferred way to represent JSO <tt>enum</tt> (only a
limited form of which is retained) and also the way to represent
JSO <tt>anyOf</tt>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>The length of text strings (as used with <tt>minLength</tt>/<tt>maxLength</tt>
constraints) was previously defined in bytes.
It now is defined as the number of characters (Unicode scalar
values, to be exact); a length in bytes is not meaningful unless
bound to a specific encoding, which might differ from UTF-8 in some
ecosystem mappings and protocol bindings.</t>
