      <t>
   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases where different SIP private header extensions referred to as "P-" header fields, and defined in RFC 7315, need to be included in SIP requests and responses where they were not allowed according to RFC 7315. This document updates RFC 7315, in order to allow inclusion of the affected "P-" header fields in such requests and responses. This document obsoletes RFC 7976. The changes related to RFC 7976 involve the inclusion of the P-Visited-Network-ID header field in SIP responses.

										  <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/> contains contradictory statements regarding the usage of SIP
					   "P-" header fields in SIP requests and responses, which leave the presence of the SIP "P-" header fields in the SIP requests and
					   responses open to interpretation and different implementations. Statements in <xref target="RFC7315" section="5.7"/> are not aligned with the
					   definitions and usage of the SIP "P-" header fields specified in <xref target="RFC7315" section="4"/>.  This section describes the misalignments that occurred
					   when <xref target="RFC3455" format="default"/> was updated and subsequently obsoleted by the publication of <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/>, and how they are fixed.
        </t>
        <aside><t> 
					   NOTE: In the case of the P-Called-Party-ID header field, allowing it
					   in PUBLISH requests was done deliberately in <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/>.  Therefore, it
					   is not considered a misalignment.
        </t></aside>
        <t>
					   Since <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/> was published, 3GPP defined new use cases that require
					   the RFC to be updated.  This section describes the 3GPP use cases
					   behind the updates, and the updates needed to <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/> in order to
					   support the use cases.

						 The following updates are needed in order to fix the misalignments

        </t>

<ul spacing="normal">
<li>P-Associated-URI: Remove the statement that the header field can appear in
the SIP REGISTER method.</li>
<li>P-Called-Party-ID: Delete the statement that the P-Called-Party-ID header
field can appear in SIP responses.  Add a statement that the P-Called-Party-ID
header field can appear in the SIP REFER method.</li>
<li>P-Access-Network-Info: Add a statement that the P-Access-Network- Info
header field can appear in SIP responses.</li>
<li>P-Charging-Vector: Add a statement that the P-Charging-Vector header field

header field cannot appear in the SIP ACK method.</li>
<li>P-Charging-Function-Addresses: Add a statement that the
P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field can appear in SIP responses.</li>
</ul>

        <t>The following update is needed in order to clarify the usage of
        the header compared to <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/>:</t>
<ul spacing="normal">
<li>P-Visited-Network-ID: Add a statement that the P-Visited-Network-ID header
field cannot appear in the SIP NOTIFY, PRACK, INFO, and UPDATE methods. Add
statement that the P-Visited-Network-ID header field can appear in all non-100
(Trying) responses.</li>

          <t>The following updates are needed in order to implement the 3GPP
          use cases:</t>

<ul spacing="normal">
  <li>P-Access-Network-Info: Add statement that the P-Access-Network- Info

  response.</li>
  <li>P-Charging-Vector: Add statement that the P-Charging-Vector header field
  can appear in the SIP ACK method when triggered by a SIP 2xx response.</li>
</ul>

  <t>This following sections describe, for individual "P-" header fields, the
  3GPP use cases that are the basis for the updates.  The use cases are based
  on the procedures defined in <xref target="TS24.229" format="default"/>.</t>
        </section>
							   
	<section anchor="P-Access-Network-Info" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>P-Access-Network-Info</name>
          <t>  
								  
								   The P-Access-Network-Info header field may contain the Network
								   Provided Location Information (NPLI).  The NPLI is described in
								   <xref target="TS23.228" format="default"/>.
 
          </t>
          <t>
								   A proxy in possession of appropriate information about the access
								   technology might insert a P-Access-Network-Info header field with its
								   own values.  Such values are identified by the string "network-
								   provided" defined in <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/>.  Based on operator policy, roaming agreement, or both, the local time of the visited network may be
								   included.
          </t>
          <t>The Call Data Records (CDRs) generated within the IP Multimedia
          Subsystem (IMS) have to contain the NPLI in order to guarantee
          correct billing.  When an IMS session is modified, the NPLI also
          needs to be stored, as the location of the user at the time when the
          session is modified may generate a charging event.  In case of a
          session modification event at IMS, the NPLI needs to be provided:</t>

<ul spacing="normal">
  <li>when the bearer establishment is triggered, or</li>
  <li>at session release when the bearer deactivation is triggered, or</li>
  <li>when the bearer modification is triggered, e.g., a QoS modification for
  the use of a newly negotiated codec.</li>
</ul>
          <t>
									   In some scenarios, the bearer modification may be triggered by the
									   proxy upon reception of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) answer
									   within the SIP 2xx response to the SIP INVITE request.  In such case, the
									   NPLI needs to be provided within the SIP ACK request.  However, <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/>  does not allow the usage of the P-Access-Network-Info header
									   field in a SIP ACK request.
          </t>
          <t>
									   Upon reception of the SDP answer within a SIP 2xx response on the SIP
									   INVITE request, a proxy may initiate procedures to obtain the NPLI
									   and may include the P-Access-Network-Info header field with the NPLI
									   in the SIP ACK request.
          </t>
          <t>
									   The P-Access-Network-Info header field shall not be included in SIP
									   ACK requests triggered by non-2xx responses.
          </t>

          <name>P-Charging-Vector</name>
          <t>  
								  
								   <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/> defines an Inter Operator Identifier (IOI) to enable
								   different operators involved in a SIP dialog or a transaction outside
								   a dialog to identify each other by exchanging operator identification
								   information within the P-Charging-Vector header field.
          </t>
          <t>
								   In the interconnection scenarios in multi-operator environments,
								   where one or more transit operators are between the originating and
								   terminating operator, the identities of the involved transit
								   operators are represented by a transit-ioi parameter of the
								   P-Charging-Vector header field.
          </t>
          <t>
								   Transit operators can be selected independently for each SIP method
								   and direction of request.  A transit network will only have knowledge
								   of an individual SIP request, and transit network selection will be
								   an independent decision for each request and could be made based on
								   load, cost, percentage, time of day, and other factors.  For this
								   reason, it is necessary that the P-Charging-Vector header field,
								   which carries the transit IOI information, is included in each SIP
								   request and response.  However, <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/> does not allow the usage of
								   the P-Charging-Vector header field in the SIP ACK request.
								    </t>
          <t>
								    A SIP proxy that supports this extension and receives the SIP ACK
								   request may include a P-Charging-Vector header field in the SIP ACK
								   request.
          </t>
          <t>
								   The P-Charging-Vector header field shall not be included in SIP ACK
								   requests triggered by non-2xx responses.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
   The security considerations for these "P-" header fields are defined
   in <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/>.  This specification allows some header fields to be
   present in messages where they were previously not allowed, and the
   security considerations and assumptions described in <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/> (e.g.,
   regarding only sending information to trusted entities) also apply to
   those messages.  
   In addition, this specification also disallows some
   header fields to be present in messages where they were previously
   allowed.  That does not cause any security issues, but implementors
   need to be aware that implementations may not have been updated
   according to this document, and take proper actions if a header field
   occurs, or does not occur, in a message where it should occur (or
   occurs in a message where it should not occur).  
   This document adds
   the ability to include P-Access-Network-Info in ACK requests.  As
   documented in <xref target="RFC7315" format="default"/>, P-Access-Network-Info may include privacy
   sensitive information, including the user's location.  The security
   and privacy considerations for P-Access-Network-Info in ACK requests
   are similar to those for the other SIP requests discussed in 
   <xref target="RFC7315" section="6.4"/>.
   The security and privacy considerations for  the P-Visited-Network-ID header field are
   similar to those for the other SIP responses discussed in <xref target="RFC7315" section="6.3"/>.
