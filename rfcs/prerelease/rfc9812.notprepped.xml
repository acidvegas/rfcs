<t>This document specifies the approval process for changes to the

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) and its address space are
defined by <xref target="STD86"/> and <xref target="RFC4291"/>.
The management of the IPv6 address space was delegated to IANA
by <xref target="RFC1881"/>, some years before the relationship
between the IETF and IANA was formalized <xref target="RFC2860"/>
and registry details were clarified <xref target="RFC7020"/> <xref target="RFC7249"/>.</t>
      <t>Occasionally, IPv6 address space allocations are performed outside
the scope of routine allocations to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
For example, a substantial allocation was requested by an
IETF document approved by the IESG <xref target="RFC9602"/>, which moved the range
5f00::/16 from the "IPv6 Address Space" registry
<xref target="IANA1"/>
to the "IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Space" registry <xref target="IANA3"/>.</t>
      <t>At the time of writing, the allocation policy in the "IPv6 Address Space"
registry <xref target="IANA1"/> was shown as "IESG approval", whereas
a more stringent policy is appropriate for major allocations.
The present document therefore strengthens the approval level
needed for non-routine address allocations, which requires an
update to <xref target="RFC7249"/>.</t>
      <t>This document also clarifies the status of <xref target="RFC1881"/>.
This clarification is necessary because <xref target="RFC1881"/>, a joint
publication of the IAB and IESG following an IETF Last Call,
was incorrectly listed in the RFC index at the time of writing
as "Legacy", whereas it is part of the IETF Stream <xref target="RFC8729"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="approval-level-of-ipv6-address-allocations">
      <name>Approval Level of IPv6 Address Allocations</name>
      <t>Portions of the IPv6 address space are shown in the registry 
as "Reserved by IETF" <xref target="IANA1"/>. This is the address space held in reserve
for future use if ever the 125-bit unicast space (2000::/3)
is found inadequate or inappropriate.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC1881"/> did not specify an allocation policy for this space. At some
point, IANA listed "IESG approval". As defined in <xref target="BCP26"/>,
this is a rather weak requirement ("Although there is no
requirement that the request be documented in an RFC, the IESG has
the discretion to request documents...") and is "a fall-back
mechanism in the case where one of the other allowable approval
mechanisms cannot be employed...".</t>
      <t>For something as important as the majority of the spare IPv6 address
space, this process is clearly insufficient. The present document replaces
the "IESG approval" process by the "IETF Review" process as defined by <xref target="BCP26"/>. The stricter "Standards Action"
policy is not considered necessary, because there may be cases where opening up a new range of address space does not in fact require a new protocol standard.</t>
      <t>It may be noted that the allocation for <xref target="RFC9602"/>, which
was processed as a working group document, did indeed follow the more
stringent "IETF Review" process proposed by this document. Indeed, the
other two related registries <xref target="IANA2"/> <xref target="IANA3"/> cite the "IETF Review"
policy, consistent with <xref target="RFC7249"/>.</t>
      <t>This document therefore extends the first paragraph of <xref target="RFC7249" sectionFormat="of" section="2.3"/> as follows:</t>
      <t>OLD:</t>
      <blockquote>
   The vast bulk of the IPv6 address space (approximately 7/8ths of the
   whole address space) is reserved by the IETF <xref target="RFC4291"/>, with the
   expectation that further assignment of globally unique unicast
   address space will be made from this reserved space in accordance
   with future needs.
