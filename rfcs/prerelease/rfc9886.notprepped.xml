    <abstract>
<t>This document defines the Domain Name System (DNS) functionality of a Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Identity Management Entity (DIME). It is built around DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) to standardize a hierarchical registry structure and associated processes to facilitate trustable and scalable registration and lookup of information related to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The registry system supports issuance, discovery, and verification of DETs, enabling secure identification and association of UAS and their operators. It also defines the interactions between different classes of registries (root, organizational, and individual) and their respective roles in maintaining the integrity of the registration data. This architecture enables decentralized, federated operation while supporting privacy, traceability, and regulatory compliance requirements in the context of UAS Remote Identification and other services.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Registries are fundamental to Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Remote Identification (RID). Only very limited operational information can be sent via Broadcast RID, but extended information is sometimes needed. The most essential element of information from RID is the UAS ID, the unique key for lookup of extended information in relevant registries (see <xref target="rfc9434-fig4"/>, which is the same as Figure 4 of <xref target="RFC9434"/>).</t>

      <t>When a DRIP Entity Tag (DET) <xref target="RFC9374"/> is used as the UAS ID in RID, extended information can be retrieved from a DRIP Identity Management Entity (DIME), which manages registration of and associated lookups from DETs. In this document it is assumed the DIME is a function of UAS Service Suppliers (USS) (<xref section="A.2" target="RFC9434"/>), but a DIME can be independent or handled by another entity as well.</t>

        <name>General Concept</name>

        <t>DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) embed a hierarchy scheme that is mapped onto the Domain Name System (DNS) <xref target="STD13"/>. DIMEs enforce registration and information access of data associated with a DET while also providing the trust inherited from being a member of the hierarchy. Other identifiers and their methods are out of scope for this document.</t>
        <t>Authoritative name servers of the DNS provide the public information such as the cryptographic keys, endorsements and certificates of DETs, and pointers to private information resources. Cryptographic (public) keys are used to authenticate anything signed by a DET, such as in the Authentication Messages defined in <xref target="RFC9575"/> for Broadcast RID. Endorsements and certificates are used to endorse the claim of being part of the hierarchy.</t>

      <t>Due to the nature of the hierarchy split and its relationship to nibble reversing of the IPv6 address (Section <xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="bare" target="RFC3596"/> of RFC 3596 <xref target="STD88"/>), the upper level of the hierarchy (i.e., Registered Assigning Authority (RAA)) "borrows" the upper two bits of their respective HHIT Domain Authority (HDA) space for DNS delegation. As such, the IPv6 prefix of RAAs is <tt>2001:3x:xxx0::/44</tt> and HDAs is <tt>2001:3x:xxxy:yy00::/56</tt> with respective nibble reverse domains of <tt>x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.</tt> and <tt>y.y.y.x.x.x.x.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.</tt>.</t>
      <t>This document preallocates a subset of RAAs based on the ISO 3166-1 Numeric Nation Code <xref target="ISO3166-1"/>. This is to support the initial use case of DETs in UAS RID on an international level. See <xref target="iana-raa"/> for the RAA allocations.</t>
      <t>The HDA values of 0, 4096, 8192, and 12288 are reserved for operational use of an RAA (a by-product of the above mentioned borrowing of bits), in particular to specify when to register with the apex and endorse delegations of HDAs in their namespace.</t>
      <t>The administration, management, and policy for the operation of a DIME at any level in the hierarchy (Apex, RAA or HDA) is out of scope for this document. For RAAs or DETs allocated on a per-country basis, these considerations should be determined by the appropriate national authorities, presumably the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</t>
      <section anchor="use-of-existing-dns-models">
        <name>Use of Existing DNS Models</name>
        <t>DRIP relies on the DNS and as such roughly follows the registrant-registrar-registry model. In the UAS ecosystem, the registrant would be the end user who owns/controls the Unmanned Aircraft. They are ultimately responsible for the DET and any other information that gets published in the DNS. Registrants use agents known as registrars to manage their interactions with the registry. Registrars typically provide optional additional services such as DNS hosting.</t>
        <t>The registry maintains a database of the registered domain names and their related metadata such as the contact details for domain name holder and the relevant registrar. The registry provides DNS service for the zone apex, which contains delegation information for domain names. Registries generally provide services such as the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) <xref target="STD95"/> or equivalent to publish metadata about the registered domain names and their registrants and registrars.</t>
        <t>Registrants have contracts with registrars who in turn have contracts with registries. Payments follow this model too: the registrant buys services from a registrar who pays for services provided by the registry.</t>
        <t>By definition, there can only be one registry for a domain name. A registry can have an arbitrary number of registrars who compete with each other on price, service, and customer support.</t>

          <t>While the registrant-registrar-registry model is mature and well understood, it may not be appropriate for DRIP registrations in some circumstances. It could add costs and complexity to develop policies and contracts as outlined above. On the other hand, registries and registrars offer customer service and support and can provide the supporting infrastructure for reliable DNS and RDAP service.</t>
          <t>Another approach could be to handle DRIP registrations in a comparable way to how IP address space gets provisioned. Here, blocks of addresses get delegated to a "trusted" third party, typically an ISP, who then issues IP addresses to its customers. For DRIP, blocks of IP addresses could be delegated from the <tt>3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.</tt> domain (reverse domain of prefix allocated by <xref target="RFC9374"/>) to an entity chosen by the appropriate Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). This third party would be responsible for the corresponding DNS and RDAP infrastructure for these IP address blocks. They would also provision the HHIT records <xref target="RFC9374"/> for these IP addresses. In principle, a manufacturer or vendor of UAS devices could provide that role. This is shown as an example in <xref target="dns-model-fig"/>.</t>
          <t>Dynamic DRIP registration is another possible solution, for example when the operator of a UAS device registers its corresponding HHIT record and other resources before a flight and deletes them afterwards. This may be feasible in controlled environments with well-behaved actors. However, this approach may not scale since each device is likely to need credentials for updating the IT infrastructure that provisions the DNS.</t>
          <t>Registration policies (pricing, renewals, registrar, and registrant agreements, etc.) will need to be developed. These considerations should be determined by the CAA, perhaps in consultation with local stakeholders to assess the cost-benefits of these approaches (and others). All of these are out of scope for this document. The specifics for the UAS RID use case are detailed in the rest of document.</t>

      <name>Public Information Registry</name>
      <t>Per <xref target="RFC9434"/>, all information classified as public is stored in the DNS, specifically authoritative name servers, to satisfy REG-1 from <xref target="RFC9153"/>.</t>
      <t>Authoritative name servers use domain names as identifiers and data is stored in Resource Records (RRs) with associated RRTypes. This document defines two new RRTypes, one for HHIT metadata (HHIT, <xref target="hhit-rr"/>) and another for UAS Broadcast RID information (BRID, <xref target="bcast-rr"/>). The former RRType is particularly important as it contains a URI (as part of the certificate) that points to Private Information resources.</t>
      <t>DETs, being IPv6 addresses, are to be under <tt>ip6.arpa.</tt> (nibble reversed per Section <xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="bare" target="RFC3596"/> of RFC 3596 <xref target="STD88"/>) and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> resolve to an HHIT RRType. Depending on local circumstances or additional use cases, other RRTypes <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be present (for example the inclusion of the DS RRTypes or equivalent when using DNSSEC). For UAS RID, the BRID RRType <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present to provide the Broadcast Endorsements (BEs) defined in <xref section="3.1.2.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9575"/>.</t>
      <t>DNSSEC <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used for apex entities (those which use a self-signed <tt>Canonical Registration Certificate</tt>) and is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> for other entities. When a DIME decides to use DNSSEC, they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> define a framework for cryptographic algorithms and key management <xref target="RFC6841"/>. This may be influenced by the frequency of updates, size of the zone, and policies.</t>
      <t>UAS-specific information, such as physical characteristics, may also be stored in DNS but is out of scope for this document.</t>
      <t>A DET IPv6 address gets mapped into domain names using the scheme defined in Section <xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="bare" target="RFC3596"/> of RFC 3596 <xref target="STD88"/>. However, DNS lookups of these names query for HHIT and/or BRID resource records rather than the PTR resource records conventionally used in reverse lookups of IP addresses. For example, the HHIT resource record for the DET <tt>2001:30::1</tt> would be returned from a DNS lookup for the HHIT QTYPE for <tt>1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.3.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.</tt>.</t>
      <t>The HHIT RRType provides the public key for signature verification and URIs via the certificate. The BRID RRType provides static Broadcast RID information such as the Broadcast Endorsements sent as described in <xref target="RFC9575"/>.</t>

Absent of such a policy, this field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be filled with the four character hexadecimal representations of the RAA and HDA (in that order) with a separator character, such as a space, in between. For example, a DET with an RAA value of 10 and HDA value of 20 would be abbreviated as: <tt>000A 0014</tt>.</t>

        <name>DNS Operational and Registration Considerations</name>
        <t>The Registrar and Registry are commonly used concepts in the DNS. 
   These components connect the DIME with the DNS hierarchy and thus
   operation <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> follow best common practices, specifically in
   security (such as running DNSSEC) as appropriate except when national
   regulations prevent it. <xref target="BCP237"/> provides suitable guidance.</t>
        <t>If DNSSEC is used, a DNSSEC Practice Statement <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be developed and published. It <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> explain how DNSSEC has been deployed and what security measures are in place. <xref target="RFC6841"/> documents a framework for DNSSEC policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements. A self-signed entity (i.e., an entity that self-signed its certificate as part of the HHIT RRType) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use DNSSEC.</t>
        <t>The interfaces and protocol specifications for registry-registrar interactions are intentionally not specified in this document. These will depend on nationally defined policy and prevailing local circumstances. It is expected that registry-registrar activity will use the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) <xref target="STD69"/> or equivalent. The registry <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a lookup service such as RDAP <xref target="STD95"/> or equivalent to publish public information about registered domain names.</t>
        <t>Decisions about DNS or registry best practices and other operational matters that influence security <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be made by the CAA, ideally in consultation with local stakeholders.</t>
        <t>The guidance above is intended to reduce the likelihood of interoperability problems and minimize security and stability concerns. For instance, validation and authentication of DNS responses depends on DNSSEC. If this is not used, entities using DRIP will be vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks and could be exposed to bogus data. DRIP DNS responses that have not been validated by DNSSEC could contain bogus data that have the potential to create serious security problems and operational concerns for DRIP entities. These threats include denial-of-service attacks, replay attacks, impersonation or cloning of UAVs, hijacking of DET registrations, injection of corrupt metadata, and compromising established trust architecture/relationships. Some regulatory and legal considerations are expected to be simplified by providing a lookup service for access to public information about registered domain names for DETs.</t>
        <t>When DNSSEC is not in use, due to the length of the ORCHID hash selected for DETs (<xref section="3.5" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9374"/>), clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> "walk" the tree of certificates locating each certificate by performing DNS lookups of HHIT RRTypes for each DET verifying inclusion into the hierarchy. The collection of these certificates (which provide both signature protection from the parent entity and the public key of the entity) is the only way without DNSSEC to prove valid registration.</t>
        <t>The contents of the BRID RRType <tt>auth</tt> key, containing Endorsements as described in <xref section="4.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9575"/>, are a shadow of the X.509 certificate found in the HHIT RRType. The validation of these Endorsements follow the guidelines written in <xref section="6.4.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9575"/> for Broadcast RID Observers and when present <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be validated.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="det-public-key-exposure">
        <name>DET and Public Key Exposure</name>
        <t>DETs are built upon asymmetric keys. As such the public key must be revealed to enable clients to perform signature verifications. <xref target="RFC9374"/> security considerations cover various attacks on such keys. While unlikely, the forging of a corresponding private key is possible if given enough time (and computational power).</t>
        <t>When practical, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that no RRTypes under a DET's specific domain name be published unless and until it is required for use by other parties. Such action would cause at least the HHIT RRType to not be in the DNS, protecting the public key in the certificate from being exposed before its needed. The combination of this "just in time" publishing mechanism and DNSSEC is out of scope for this document.</t>
        <t>Optimally this requires that the UAS somehow signal to the DIME that a flight using a Specific Session ID will soon be underway or complete. It may also be facilitated under UTM if the USS (which may or may not be a DIME) signals when a given operation using a Session ID goes active.</t>
