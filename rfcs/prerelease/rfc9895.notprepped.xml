        This document defines an extension to the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) that
        enables an Ethernet IEEE 802.1Q aware credit window scheme for
        destination-specific and shared flow control.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in
	<xref target="RFC8175"/>.  The protocol provides the exchange of link-related
        control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers 
        consist of a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of
        mechanisms as well as support for possible extensions.  This
        document defines one such extension.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DLEP specification does not define any flow control
        mechanisms. While in theory various flow control techniques could be
        implemented with DLEP, this document specifies a
        DLEP extension that introduces an Ethernet-based flow control
        mechanism for traffic transmitted from a router to a modem. This
        mechanism utilizes one or more logical "credit windows", each of
        which is typically associated with a virtual or physical
        queue. The router leverages traffic flow classification
        information provided by the modem to determine the appropriate
        credit window for a given traffic flow. Credit windows may be
        shared across multiple flows or used on a per-flow basis. For a
        Diffserv-based approach to credit window flow control, refer to
        <xref target="RFC9894"/>. As
        specified in <xref section="2.3.1" target="RFC9892"/>, when both
        Diffserv and Ethernet traffic classification are applied to a
        flow, Ethernet-based classification takes precedence.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document leverages the traffic classification and credit
        window flow control mechanisms defined in <xref target="RFC9892"/> and <xref target="RFC9893"/> to enable
        credit-window-based flow control based on DLEP destinations,
        Ethernet Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), and Priority Code Points (PCPs). Ethernet PCP
        support is specified as part of the IEEE 802.1Q tag format <xref target="IEEE8021Q"/>, which includes a 3-bit "PCP"
        field. The tag format also incorporates a 12-bit "VLAN
        Identifier (VID)" field.
      </t>
      <t>
        The defined mechanism allows credit windows to be shared across
        traffic destined for multiple DLEP destinations, VLANs, and PCPs, or to be dedicated exclusively
        to traffic associated with a specific destination, VLAN, and/or
        PCP. Additionally, this extension supports "wildcard" matching
        for any PCP or VID.
      </t>
      <t>
        The extension defined in this document is referred to as the "IEEE
        802.1Q Aware Credit Window" or, more simply, the "Ethernet
        Credit" extension. The reader should be familiar with both the
        traffic classification and credit window flow control mechanisms
        defined in <xref target="RFC9892"/>
	and <xref target="RFC9893"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type value that is used to indicate support for the extension. See <xref target="sec-ext-type"/>.

        The extension defined in this document is built on the
        mechanisms and processing defined in <xref target="RFC9892"/> and <xref target="RFC9893"/>.  To indicate
        that the IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window Extension is to be
        used, an implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the IEEE 802.1Q Aware
        Credit Window Extension Type value in the Extensions Supported Data Item (see
        <xref target="RFC8175" section="13.6"/>).
        The Extensions Supported Data Item is sent and processed
        according to <xref target="RFC8175"/>.  Any implementation that
        indicates the use of the IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window Extension
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support all message types, Data Items, the Ethernet Traffic
        Classification Sub-Data Item, and all related processing defined
        in <xref target="RFC9892"/>
        and <xref target="RFC9893"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        The IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window Extension Type value is
        5. See <xref target="sec-iana"/>.

      <name>Management Considerations</name>
      <t>
        This section provides several network management guidelines for
        implementations supporting the IEEE 802.1Q Aware Credit Window
        Extension.
      </t>
      <t>
        If this extension is supported, that support <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be declared
        using the Extensions Supported Data Item (see 
        <xref target="RFC8175" section="13.6"/>), which is configurable on both modems
        and routers.  Diffserv Aware Credit Window Extension Data Items
        <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be emitted by a DLEP participant unless such support
        was specified in the initialization message received from its
        peer.  The use of the extension defined in this document <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
        be configurable on both modems and routers.
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support the configuration of mapping a PCP to a credit window (queue).
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> support the configuration of mapping a PCP to a credit window (queue) on a per-VLAN basis. VID value zero (0x0000) is used
        by <xref target="RFC9892"/>
        to indicate that the VID is ignored. VID 0xFFFF is
  reserved. Any other VID value from 0x0001 through 0xFFFE can be
  used in traffic classification.
      </t>
      <t>
        When VLANs are supported by a modem without support from PCPs,
	the modem <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> support the configuration of mapping a VLAN to a credit window (queue).
      </t>
      <t>
        Modems <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> support the configuration of the number of credit windows
        (queues) that they advertise to a router.
      </t>
      <t>
        Routers may impose limitations on the number of queues they can
        support and on the allowable credit window configurations. In
        some cases, per-destination queues may not be supported. If the
        credit window information provided by the modem exceeds the
        router's capabilities, the router <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> utilize a subset of the
        advertised credit windows. Alternatively, the router <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> reset
        the session and indicate that the extension is not supported. In
        either case, any mismatch in capabilities <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be reported to
        the user through standard network management mechanisms, such as
        user interface notifications or error logging.
      </t>
      <t>
        Regardless of implementation, if credit windows are in use, the
        router <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send traffic to the modem unless sufficient
        credits are available.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        This document defines a DLEP extension that uses DLEP mechanisms
        and the credit window flow control mechanisms defined in
        <xref target="RFC9892"/> and
        <xref target="RFC9893"/>. See
	also the Security Considerations sections of those documents.
      </t>
      <t>
	The defined extension is exposed to vulnerabilities similar to
	existing DLEP messages and discussed in the Security
	Considerations section of <xref target="RFC8175"/>, such as an
	injected message resizing a credit window to a value that
	results in a denial of service. The security mechanisms
	documented in <xref target="RFC8175"/> can be applied equally to
	the mechanism defined in this document.
      </t>
      <t>
	Wildcards for matching PCP and VID fields are provided. Note that wildcards may
	be convenient for matching a number of packet flows but could
	inadvertently match unexpected flows or new flows that appear
	after the wildcard matching has been set up. It is therefore
	<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that wildcards not be used unless clearly needed.
