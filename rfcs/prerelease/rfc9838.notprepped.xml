      <t> This document presents an extension to the Internet Key Exchange
      Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for the purpose of group key management. The
      protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key
      Management architecture, which contains two components: member
      registration and group rekeying. Both components are required for a
      Group Controller/Key Server (GCKS) to provide authorized Group Members
      (GMs) with IPsec Group Security Associations (GSAs). The GMs then
      exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets.

      <name>Introduction and Overview</name>
      <t>This document presents an extension to IKEv2
      <xref target="RFC7296"/> called G-IKEv2, which accommodates group key management. A group key management protocol provides IPsec keys and policy to a
      set of IPsec devices that are authorized to communicate using a Group
      Security Association (GSA) defined in Multicast Group Security Architecture <xref target="RFC3740"/>.
      The data communications within the group (e.g., IP multicast packets)
      are protected by a key pushed to the Group Members (GMs) by the Group Controller/Key Server (GCKS). </t>
      <t>G-IKEv2 conforms to "The Multicast Group Security
      Architecture" <xref target="RFC3740"/>, "Multicast Extensions to the
      Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol" <xref target="RFC5374"/>,
      and "Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture" <xref target="RFC4046"/>.
      G-IKEv2 replaces "The Group Domain of Interpretation" <xref target="RFC6407"/>, which defines a
      similar group key management protocol using IKEv1 <xref target="RFC2409"/> (since deprecated by IKEv2). When G-IKEv2 is
      used, group key management use cases can benefit from the simplicity,
      increased robustness, and cryptographic improvements of IKEv2 (see
      <xref section="A" target="RFC7296"/>).</t>
      <t>G-IKEv2 is composed of two phases: registration and rekeying. In the registration phase, a GM
      contacts a GCKS to register to a group and to receive the necessary policy and the keying material 
      to be able communicate with the other GMs in the group as well as with the GCKS. 
      The rekeying phase allows the GCKS to periodically renew the keying material for both GM-to-GM
      communications as well as for communication between the GM and the GCKS.  
      </t>
      <t>G-IKEv2 defines two ways to perform registration. When a GM first
      contacts a GCKS, it uses the GSA_AUTH exchange (<xref
      target="gsa_auth"/>) to register to a group. This exchange happens after
      the IKE_SA_INIT exchange (similarly to the IKE_AUTH exchange in IKEv2)
      and results in establishing an IKE Security Association (SA) between the GM and the GCKS.
      During this exchange, the GCKS authenticates and authorizes the GM and then
      pushes policy and keys used by the group to the GM.  The second new
      exchange type is the GSA_REGISTRATION exchange (<xref
      target="gsa_registration"/>), which can be used by the GM within the already-established
      IKE SA with the GCKS (e.g., for registering to another
      group).
      </t>
      <t>Refreshing the group keys can be performed either in a unicast mode via the
      GSA_INBAND_REKEY exchange (<xref target="gsa_inband_rekey"/>) performed over a specific IKE SA between a GM and a GCKS 
      or in a multicast mode with the GSA_REKEY pseudo-exchange (<xref target="gsa_rekey"/>) when new keys are being distributed to all GMs.
      </t>
      <t>Large and small groups may use different sets of these mechanisms.
      When a large group of devices are communicating, the GCKS is likely to
      use the GSA_REKEY message for efficiency. This is shown in <xref target="large-groups"/>, where multicast communications are indicated with a double line.</t> 
<aside><t>Note: For clarity, IKE_SA_INIT is omitted from Figures <xref target="large-groups" format="counter"/> and <xref target="small-groups" format="counter"/>.</t></aside>

      <t>Alternatively, a small group may simply use the GSA_AUTH or GSA_REGISTRATION as
      registration protocols, where the GCKS issues rekeys using the
      GSA_INBAND_REKEY within the same IKE SA.

      <t> A combination of these approaches is also possible. For example,  
      the GCKS may use more robust GSA_INBAND_REKEY to provide keys for some GMs 
      (for example, those acting as senders in the group) and GSA_REKEY for the rest.</t>
<aside><t>Note: GCKS may also be a GM (as shown in <xref target="small-groups"/>).
      </t></aside>
      <t>IKEv2 message semantics are preserved in that all communications
      consist of message request-response pairs. The exception to this rule
      is the GSA_REKEY pseudo-exchange, which is a single message delivering group
      updates to the GMs.</t>

      <name>G-IKEv2 Protocol</name>
      <t>G-IKEv2 is an extension to the IKEv2 protocol <xref target="RFC7296"/> that provides group authorization, 
        secure policy, and keys download from the GCKS to GMs. 
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>G-IKEv2 Integration into the IKEv2 Protocol</name>
        <t>G-IKEv2 is compatible with most IKEv2 extensions defined so far (see <xref target="ike_ext"/> for details). 
        In particular, it is assumed that, if necessary, the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges <xref target="RFC9242"/> may be utilized 
        while establishing the registration SA. It is also believed that 
        future IKEv2 extensions will be possible to use with G-IKEv2. However, some IKEv2 extensions may require 
        special handling when used with G-IKEv2.</t>
        <section>
          <name>G-IKEv2 Transport and Port</name>
          <t> As an IKEv2 extension, G-IKEv2 <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the IKEv2 ports (500, 4500). 
G-IKEv2 <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use TCP transport for the IKE SA used for registration (which is unicast),
   as defined in TCP Encapsulation of IKEv2 and IPsec <xref target="RFC9329"/>.
          G-IKEv2 <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also use UDP port 848, the same as Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) <xref target="RFC6407"/>, because they serve a similar function. 
          The version number in the IKE header distinguishes the G-IKEv2
          protocol from the GDOI protocol <xref target="RFC6407"/>. 
          </t>
          <t><xref target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of"
          section="2.23"/> describes how IKEv2 supports paths with NATs.
          The G-IKEv2 registration SA doesn't create any unicast IPsec SAs; thus,
          if a NAT is present between the GM and the GCKS, there is no unicast
          ESP traffic to encapsulate in UDP. However, the actions described in
          this section regarding the IKE SA <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be honored.
          The behavior of GMs and GCKS <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> depend on the
          port used to create the initial IKE SA.  For example, if the GM and
          the GCKS used UDP port 848 for the IKE_SA_INIT exchange, they will
          operate the same as if they had used UDP port 500.

      <section anchor="registration">
        <name>G-IKEv2 Member Registration and Secure Channel Establishment</name>
        <t>Initial registration is combined with establishing a secure connection between the 
        entity seeking registration and the GCKS. This process consists of a minimum of two 
        exchanges, IKE_SA_INIT and GSA_AUTH; member registration may have a
        few more messages exchanged if the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method, cookie challenge (for
        DoS protection), negotiation of key exchange method, or IKEv2 extensions 
        based on the IKEv2 Intermediate Exchange <xref target="RFC9242"/> 
        are used. Each exchange consists of request/response pairs. The first exchange, called
        IKE_SA_INIT, is defined in IKEv2 <xref target="RFC7296"/>. 

This
        exchange negotiates cryptographic algorithms, exchanges nonces, and
        computes a shared key between the GM and the GCKS.
        In addition to the cryptographic algorithms negotiated for use in IKEv2 SA,
        a key wrap algorithm is also negotiated in this exchange by means of a new "Key Wrap Algorithm" transform. 
        See <xref target="wrapped_key"/> for details.
        </t>
        <t>The second exchange, called GSA_AUTH, is similar to the IKEv2 IKE_AUTH exchange <xref target="RFC7296"/>.
        It authenticates the previously exchanged messages and exchanges identities and certificates. 
        The GSA_AUTH messages are encrypted and integrity protected with keys established through the previous
        exchanges, so the identities are hidden from eavesdroppers and all
        fields in all the messages are authenticated. The GCKS authorizes
        GMs to be allowed into the group as part of the
        GSA_AUTH exchange. Once the GCKS accepts a GM to join a
        group, it will provide the GM with the data-security keys (TEKs) and/or a group key
        encrypting key (KEK) as part of the GSA_AUTH response message. </t>
        <t>The established secure channel between the GM and the GCKS is in fact IKE SA (as defined in 
        <xref target="RFC7296"/>) and is referred to as such throughout this document. 
        However, it is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to use this IKE SA for the purpose of creating
        unicast Child SAs between the GM and the GCKS since authentication requirements for 
        group admission and for unicast communication may differ. In addition, the life cycle
        of this IKE SA is determined by the GCKS and this SA can be deleted at any time.
        </t>
        <section anchor="gsa_auth">
          <name>GSA_AUTH Exchange</name>
          <t>The GSA_AUTH exchange is used to authenticate the previous exchanges and
          exchange identities and certificates. G-IKEv2 also uses this
          exchange for GM registration and authorization.
          </t>
          <t> The GSA_AUTH exchange is similar to the IKE_AUTH exchange with the 
          difference that its goal is to establish a multicast Data-Security SA(s)
          and optionally provide GM with the keys for a Rekey SA. The set of payloads 
          in the GSA_AUTH exchange is slightly different because policy is not
          negotiated between the GM and the GCKS; instead, it is 
          provided by the GCKS for the GM. Also note that GSA_AUTH 
          has its own exchange type, which is different from the IKE_AUTH exchange type.
          </t>
          <aside><t>Note: Due to the similarities between IKE_AUTH and GSA_AUTH,
          most IKEv2 extensions to the IKE_AUTH exchange 
          (like secure password authentication <xref target="RFC6467"/>) can also be used with the GSA_AUTH exchange.

          Transforms it is willing to accept. A GM that intends to act as group sender 
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include a Notify payload status type of GROUP_SENDER,

          etc. In these cases (see <xref target="notify"/>), the GSA_AUTH
          response will not include the GSA and KD but will include a Notify
          payload indicating errors. If a GM included an SAg
          payload and the GCKS chooses to evaluate it and detects that
          the GM cannot support the security policy defined for the
          group, then the GCKS returns the NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN notification.
          Other types of error notifications can be INVALID_GROUP_ID, AUTHORIZATION_FAILED, or REGISTRATION_FAILED.</t>

          <name>GM Registration Operations</name>
          <t>A GM requesting registration contacts the
          GCKS using the IKE_SA_INIT exchange. This exchange is unchanged from IKE_SA_INIT 
          in the IKEv2 protocol. 


The IKE_SA_INIT exchange may optionally be followed 
          by one or more of the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges if the GM and the GCKS
          negotiated use of IKEv2 extensions based on this exchange.
          </t>
          <t>Next, the GM sends the GSA_AUTH request message with the IKEv2 payloads
          from IKE_AUTH (without the SAi2, TSi, and TSr payloads) along with
          the Group ID informing the GCKS of the group the GM wishes to
          join. A GM intending to emit data traffic <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send a
          GROUP_SENDER notification. The GROUP_SENDER notification not only signifies that it
          is a sender but provides the GM the ability to request
          Sender-ID values in case the Data-Security SA supports a counter-mode cipher. <xref target="sid_alloc"/> includes guidance
          on requesting Sender-ID values.</t>
          <t>A GM may be limited in the Transforms IDs that it is
          able or willing to use and may find it useful to inform the GCKS
          which Transform IDs it is willing to accept for different security protocols
          by including the SAg payload into the request message.
          Proposals for Rekey SA and for Data-Security 
          (AH <xref target="RFC4302"/> and/or ESP <xref target="RFC4303"/>) SAs 
          may be included into SAg. Proposals for Rekey SA are identified 
          by a new Security Protocol Identifier GIKE_UPDATE with the value 6.
          Each Proposal contains a list of Transforms that the GM is able 
          and willing to support for that protocol. Valid Transform Types depend on the 
          protocol (AH, ESP, GIKE_UPDATE) and are defined in <xref target="allowed_transforms"/>.
          Other Transform Types <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be included as they will be ignored by the GCKS.
          The Security Parameter Index (SPI) length of each Proposal in an SAg is set to zero, and thus the SPI field is empty. 
          The GCKS <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use SPI length and SPI fields in the SAg payload. 
          </t>
          <t>Generally, a single Proposal for each protocol (GIKE_UPDATE,
          AH/ESP) will suffice. Because the transforms are not negotiated, the
          GM simply alerts the GCKS to restrictions it may have.  In
          particular, the restriction from  <xref target="RFC7296"
          sectionFormat="of" section="3.3"/> that Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) and non-AEAD
          transforms not be combined in a single proposal doesn't hold when
          the SAg payload is being formed. However, if the GM has restrictions
          on the combination of algorithms, this can be expressed by sending
          several proposals.</t>
          <t>The Proposal Num field in the Proposal substructure is treated specially in the SAg payload:
          it allows a GM to indicate that algorithms used in Rekey SA and in 
          Data-Security (AH and/or ESP) SAs are dependent.
          In particular, Proposals for different protocols having the same value in the
          Proposal Num field are treated as a set so that if GCKS uses transforms
          from one of such Proposal for one protocol, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only use transforms from 
          one of the Proposals with the same value in the Proposal Num field for other protocols.
          For example, a GM may support algorithms X and Y for both Rekey and
          Data-Security SAs, but with a restriction that if X is used in  Rekey SAs, then only X can be used
          in Data-Security SAs, and the same for Y. 
          Use of the same value in the Proposal Num field of different
          proposals indicates that the GM expects these proposals to be
          used in conjunction with each other.
          In the simplest case when no dependency between transforms exists,
          all Proposals in the SAg payload will have the same value in the Proposal Num field.
          </t>
          <t>Although the SAg payload is optional, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the GM include
          this payload into the GSA_AUTH request to allow the GCKS to select an appropriate policy.
          </t>
          <t>A GM <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also indicate the support for IPcomp by including one or more the IPCOMP_SUPPORTED
          notifications along with the SAg payload in the request. The Compression Parameter Index (CPI) in these notifications is set to zero
          and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored by the GCKS.
          </t>
          <t>Upon receiving the GSA_AUTH response, the GM parses the
          response from the GCKS authenticating the exchange using the IKEv2
          method, then processes the GSA and KD payloads.</t>
          <t>The GSA payload contains the security policy and cryptographic
          protocols used by the group.

This policy describes zero or more Data-Security SAs (TEK), zero or one Rekey SA (KEK), and zero or one GW policy (although at least one TEK or KEK policy <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
   Present).
          If the policy in the GSA payload is not acceptable to the GM,
          it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> notify the GCKS by initiating a GSA_REGISTRATION exchange 
          with a NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN Notify payload (see <xref target="gsa_registration"/>). 
          Note that this should normally not happen if the GM includes the SAg payload 
          in the GSA_AUTH request and the GCKS takes it into account.
          Finally, the KD payload is parsed, providing the keying material for the TEK and/or KEK. 
          The KD payload contains a list of key bags, where each key bag includes the
          keying material for SAs distributed in the GSA payload. Keying
          material is matched by comparing the SPIs in the key bags to SPIs
          previously included in the GSA payloads. Once TEK keys and policy
          are matched, the GM provides them to the data-security subsystem,
          and it is ready to send or receive packets matching the TEK
          policy.</t>
          <t> If the GM is not a sender for a received Data-Security SA, 
          then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> install this SA only in the inbound direction.
          If the GM is a sender for a received Data-Security SA, 
          and it is not going to receive back the data it sends, 
          then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> install this SA only in the outgoing direction.
          </t>
          <t>If the first Message ID the GM should expect to receive is non-zero,
          the GSA KEK policy includes the attribute GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID with
          the expected non-zero value.
          The value of the attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be checked by a GM against any previously received Message ID for this group.
          If it is less than the previously received number, it should be
          considered stale and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored. This could happen if two GSA_AUTH
          exchanges happened in parallel and the Message ID changed. This
          attribute is used by the GM to prevent GSA_REKEY message replay
          attacks. The first GSA_REKEY message that the GM receives from the
          GCKS will have a Message ID greater than or equal to the Message ID
          received in the GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID attribute.</t>
          <t>GMs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> install the Rekey SA only in the inbound direction.
          </t>
          <t>Once a GM successfully registers to the group, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> replace
          any information related to this group (policy, keys) that it might
          have as a result of a previous registration with a new one.
          </t>
          <t>Once a GM has received the GIKE_UPDATE policy during a registration,
          the IKE SA <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be closed.  By convention, the GCKS
          closes the IKE SA; the GM <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> close it.  The
          GCKS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose to keep the IKE SA open for inband
          rekey, especially for small groups.  If inband rekey is used, then

          IKEv2 mechanism described in <xref target="RFC7296"

          IKE SA is closed and no GIKE_UPDATE policy is received during the

          excluded from the group.  To continue participating in the group,
          the GM needs to re-register.

          <name>GCKS Registration Operations</name>
          <t>A G-IKEv2 GCKS listens for incoming requests from GMs. When the GCKS receives an IKE_SA_INIT request, it selects
          an IKE proposal and generates a nonce and Diffie-Hellman (DH) to include in the
          IKE_SA_INIT response.</t>
          <t>Upon receiving the GSA_AUTH request, the GCKS authenticates the
          GM via the GSA_AUTH exchange. The
          GCKS then authorizes the GM according to group policy
          before preparing to send the GSA_AUTH response. If the GCKS fails to
          authorize the GM, it responds with an AUTHORIZATION_FAILED
          notification. The GCKS may also respond with an INVALID_GROUP_ID notification
          if the requested group is unknown to the GCKS or with an REGISTRATION_FAILED
          notification if there is a problem with the requested group (e.g., if
          the capacity of the group is exceeded).</t>
          <t>The GSA_AUTH response will include the group policy in the GSA
          payload and keys in the KD payload. 
If the GCKS policy includes a
          group rekey option and the initial Message ID value the GCKS will use when sending the GSA_REKEY messages 
          to the GMs is non-zero, then this value is specified in the GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID attribute. 
          This Message ID is used to prevent GSA_REKEY 
          message replay attacks and will be increased each time a GSA_REKEY message is sent
          to the group. The GCKS data traffic policy is included in the GSA
          TEK and keys are included in the KD TEK. The GW policy <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also be
          included to provide the Activation
   Time Delay (ATD) and/or Deactivation Time Delay (DTD) (<xref target="gwp_attr_atd_dtd"/>) 
          to specify activation and deactivation
          delays for SAs generated from the TEKs. If the GM has
          indicated that it is a sender of data traffic and one or more Data-Security SAs distributed in the GSA payload included a counter mode
          of operation, the GCKS responds with one or more Sender-ID values (see <xref target="counter-modes"/>).</t>
          <t> Multicast Extensions to the Security Architecture <xref target="RFC5374"/> defines two modes of operation for multicast 
          Data-Security SAs: transport mode and tunnel mode with address preservation.
          In the latter case, outer source and destination addresses are taken from
          the inner IP packet. The mode of operation for the Data-Security SAs is determined 
          by the presence of the USE_TRANSPORT_MODE notification 
          in the GCKS's response message of the registration exchange. If it is present,
          then SAs are created in transport mode; otherwise, SAs are created in tunnel mode.
          If multiple Data-Security SAs are being created in a single registration exchange,
          then all of them will have the same mode of operation.
          </t>
          <t>If the GCKS receives a GSA_REGISTRATION exchange with a request
          to register a GM to a group, the GCKS will need to authorize the GM
          with the new group (IDg) and respond with the corresponding group
          policy and keys. If the GCKS fails to authorize the GM, it will
          respond with the AUTHORIZATION_FAILED notification. The GCKS may also 
          respond with an INVALID_GROUP_ID or REGISTRATION_FAILED notify messages 
          for the reasons described above.</t>
          <t>If a GM includes an SAg in its GSA_AUTH or
          GSA_REGISTRATION request, the GCKS may evaluate it according to an
          implementation-specific policy.

          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>

              include all of the ESP, AH, or GIKE_UPDATE Transforms that match the current group policy
              or the capabilities of all other currently active GMs, 
              then the GCKS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> return a NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN notification.

            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The GCKS could store the list of Transforms and adjust the

          Depending on its policy, the GCKS may have no further need for the
          IKE SA (e.g., it does not plan to initiate a GSA_INBAND_REKEY
          exchange). If the GM does not initiate another registration exchange
          or Notify (e.g., NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN) and the GCKS is not intended to use the SA, then the GCKS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> close the IKE SA to save resources after a short period of time.</t>

        <name>Group Maintenance Channel</name>
        <t>The GCKS is responsible for rekeying the secure group per the group
        policy.
   Rekeying is an operation whereby the GCKS provides
   replacement TEK(s) and/or KEK, deleting TEK(s), and/or
   excluding GMs.
        The GCKS may initiate a rekey message if group membership and/or policy has
        changed or if the keys are about to expire. Two forms of group
        maintenance channels are provided in G-IKEv2 to push new policy to
        GMs.</t>
        <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
          <dt>GSA_REKEY:</dt>
          <dd>The GSA_REKEY is a pseudo-exchange, consisting
          of a one-way IKEv2 message sent by the GCKS where the rekey policy is delivered
          to GMs using IP multicast as a transport. This method is
          valuable for large and dynamic groups and where policy may change
          frequently and a scalable rekey method is required. When the
          GSA_REKEY is used, the IKE SA protecting the member
          registration exchanges is usually terminated and GMs await
          policy changes from the GCKS via the GSA_REKEY messages.</dd>
          <dt>GSA_INBAND_REKEY:</dt>
          <dd>The GSA_INBAND_REKEY is a
          normal IKEv2 exchange using the IKE SA that was set up to protect the
          member registration exchange. This exchange allows the GCKS to
          rekey without using an independent GSA_REKEY pseudo-exchange. The
          GSA_INBAND_REKEY exchange provides a reliable policy delivery and 
          is useful when G-IKEv2 is used with a small group of cooperating devices.</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>Depending on its policy, the GCKS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> combine these two methods.
        For example, the GCKS may use the GSA_INBAND_REKEY to deliver a key to the 
        GMs in the group acting as senders (as this would provide reliable keys delivery) 
        and the GSA_REKEY for the rest of the GMs.

          <t>The GCKS initiates the G-IKEv2 rekey by sending a protected
          message to the GMs, usually using IP multicast. Since the Rekey
          messages do not require responses and are sent to multiple GMs,
          the windowing mechanism described in <xref target="RFC7296"
          sectionFormat="of" section="2.3"/> <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
          be used for the Rekey messages.  The GCKS rekey message replaces the
          current rekey GSA KEK or KEK array (e.g., in the case of LKH) and/or
          creates new Data-Security SAs. The GM_SENDER_ID attribute in
          the Key Download payload (defined in <xref
          target="mkd_attr_gm_sid"/>) <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be part of the
          Rekey Exchange, as this is sender-specific information and the Rekey
          Exchange is group specific. The GCKS initiates the GSA_REKEY
          pseudo-exchange as following:</t>

          </figure>

          <t>HDR is defined in <xref target="header"/>. While GSA_REKEY reuses the IKEv2 header,
          the "IKE SA Initiator's SPI" and the "IKE SA Responder's SPI" fields are treated as a single field
          with a length of 16 octets containing the SPI of a Rekey SA. The value for this field is provided by the GCKS 
          in the GSA payload (see <xref target="gsa_policy"/>).
          The Message ID in this message will start with the value the GCKS sent to the
          GMs in the attribute GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID or from
          zero if this attribute wasn't sent. The Message ID will be incremented each time a new
          GSA_REKEY message is sent to the GMs.</t>
          <t>The GSA payload contains the current policy for rekey and Data-Security SAs.

          The GSA may contain a new Rekey SA and/or a new Data-Security SA(s) 
          (<xref target="gsa_payload"/>).</t>
          <t>The KD payload contains the keys for the policy included in the
          GSA. If one or more Data-Security SAs are being refreshed in this rekey
          message, the IPsec keys are updated in the KD, and/or if the Rekey
          SA is being refreshed in this rekey message, the rekey Key or the
          LKH KEK array (e.g., in case of LKH) is updated in the KD payload.</t>
          <t>A Delete payload <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be included to instruct the GM to delete
          existing SAs. See <xref target="delete"/> for more detail.</t>
          <t>The AUTH payload <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be included to authenticate the GSA_REKEY
          message if the authentication method is based on public key signatures
          and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be included if authentication is implicit.
          In the latter case, the fact that a GM can decrypt the GSA_REKEY message and verify its Integrity Check Value (ICV) 
          proves that the sender of this message knows the current KEK,
          thus authenticating the sender as a member of the group. 
          Note that implicit authentication doesn't provide source origin authentication.
          For this reason, using implicit authentication for GSA_REKEY is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14> 
          unless source origin authentication is not required (for example, in a small group of
          highly trusted GMs). See more about authentication methods in <xref target="auth_method"/>.
          </t>
          <t> During GM registration, the GCKS
          sends the authentication key in the KD payload, the AUTH_KEY attribute, 
          which the GM uses to authenticate the key
          server. Before the current authentication key expires, the GCKS will
          send a new AUTH_KEY to the GMs in a GSA_REKEY message.
          The authentication key that is sent in the rekey message may not
	  be the same
          as the authentication key sent during the GM registration. If implicit authentication
          is used, then AUTH_KEY <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be sent to GMs.</t>

            <name>GSA_REKEY Message Authentication</name>
            <t>The content of the AUTH payload generally depends on the authentication method from the Group Controller Authentication Method (GCAUTH) transform 
            (<xref target="auth_method"/>). 
This specification defines the use of only one authentication method, Digital Signature, and the AUTH payload contains a digital signature calculated over the content of the not-yet-encrypted GSA_REKEY message.
            </t>
            <t>The digital signing is applied to the concatenation of two chunks: A and P. 
            Chunk A starts with the first octet of the G-IKEv2 header (not including prepended four octets of zeros, if port 4500 is used) 
            and continues to the last octet of the Encrypted Payload header. 
Chunk P consists of the not-yet-encrypted content of the Encrypted payload, excluding 
            the Initialization Vector, the Padding, the Pad Length, and the Integrity Checksum Data fields (see <xref section="3.14" target="RFC7296"/> for the description 
            of the Encrypted payload). In other words, chunk P is the inner payloads of the Encrypted payload in plaintext form. 
            <xref target="auth_data"/> illustrates the layout of chunks P and A in the GSA_REKEY message.
            </t>
            <t>Before the calculation of the AUTH payload, the inner payloads
            of the Encrypted payload must be fully formed and ready for
            encryption except for the content of the AUTH payload.  The AUTH
            payload must have correct values in the Payload header, the Auth
            Method, and the RESERVED fields.  The Authentication Data field is
            zeroed, but the ASN.1 Length and the AlgorithmIdentifier fields
            must be properly filled in; see Signature Authentication in
            <xref target="RFC7427"/>.
            </t>
            <t>For the purpose of the AUTH payload calculation, the Length field in the IKE header and the Payload Length 
            field in the Encrypted Payload header are adjusted so that they don't count the lengths
            of Initialization Vector, Integrity Checksum Data, and Padding (along with Pad Length field).
            In other words, the Length field in the IKE header (denoted as AdjustedLen in  
            <xref target="auth_data"/>) is set to the sum of the lengths of A and P, and the Payload Length
            field in the Encrypted Payload header (denoted as AdjustedPldLen in 
            <xref target="auth_data"/>) is set to the length of P plus the size of the Payload header (four octets).
            </t>
            <t>The input to the digital signature algorithm that computes the content of the AUTH payload can be described as:

            <t>The GCKS builds the rekey message with a Message ID value that
            is one greater than the value included in the previous rekey message. 
            The first message sent over a new Rekey SA <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use a Message ID of 0. 
            The GSA, KD, and N payloads follow with the
            same characteristics as in the GSA Registration exchange. 
            The AUTH payload (if present) is created as defined in <xref target="gsa_rekey_auth"/>. 
            </t>
            <t>Because GSA_REKEY messages are not acknowledged and could be
            discarded by the network, one or more GMs may not receive 
            the new policy. To mitigate such lost messages, during a rekey event, the
            GCKS may transmit several copies of an encrypted GSA_REKEY message with the new
            policy. The (encrypted) retransmitted messages <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be bitwise identical and should be
            sent within a short time interval (a few seconds) to ensure 
            that the SA lifetime calculations would not be substantially skewed for the GMs that 
            would receive different copies of the messages. </t>
            <t> GCKS may also include one or several GSA_NEXT_SPI
            attributes specifying SPIs for the prospected rekeys so that
            listening GMs are able to detect lost rekey messages and recover
            from this situation. See <xref target="gsa_attr_next_spi"/> for more detail.

            <t>  When a GM receives the rekey message from the GCKS, it
            decrypts the message and verifies its integrity using the current KEK. If the AUTH payload is present
            in the decrypted message, then the GM validates authenticity of the message using the key retrieved 
            in a previous G-IKEv2 exchange. Then the GM verifies the Message ID and processes
            the GSA and KD payloads. The GM then installs the new Data-Security SA(s)
            and/or a new Rekey SA. The parsing of the payloads is identical to
            the parsing done in the registration exchange.</t>
            <t>Replay protection is achieved by a GM rejecting a
            GSA_REKEY message that has a Message ID smaller than the current
            Message ID that the GM is expecting. The GM expects the Message ID
            in the first GSA_REKEY message it receives to be equal to or greater
            than the Message ID it receives in the GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID attribute.
            Note that if the GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID attribute is not received for the Rekey SA, 
            the GM <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> assume zero as the first expected Message ID.
            The GM expects the Message ID in subsequent GSA_REKEY messages to
            be greater than the last valid GSA_REKEY message ID it
            received.</t>
            <t> This specification assumes that the GSA_REKEY messages are sent 
            with intervals that are significantly greater than typical network packet reordering intervals.
            </t>
            <t>If the GSA payload includes a Data-Security SA using cipher in 
            a counter-mode of operation and the receiving GM is a
            sender for that SA, the GM uses its current Sender-ID value
            with the Data-Security SAs to create counter-mode nonces. If it is
            a sender and does not hold a current Sender-ID value (for example,
            when no counter-mode is employed for other Data-Security SAs), 
            it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> install the Data-Security SAs. It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> initiate a re-registration
            to the GCKS in order to obtain a Sender-ID value (along with
            the current group policy). 
            </t>
           <t>Once a new Rekey SA is installed as a result of a GSA_REKEY
            message, the current Rekey SA (over which the message was received)
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be silently deleted after waiting the DEACTIVATION_TIME_DELAY interval 
            regardless of its expiration time. If the message includes a Delete payload
            for an existing Data-Security SA, then after installing a new Data-Security SA, the old one 
            (identified by the Protocol and SPI fields in the Delete payload) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be silently deleted 
            after waiting the DEACTIVATION_TIME_DELAY interval regardless of its expiration time.
            </t>
            <t>If a Data-Security SA is not rekeyed yet and is 
            about to expire (a "soft lifetime" expiration is described
            in <xref target="RFC4301" sectionFormat="of" section="4.4.2.1"/>), the GM <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
            initiate a registration to the GCKS. This registration serves as a
            request for current SAs and will result in the download of
            replacement SAs, assuming the GCKS policy has created them.
            A GM <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also initiate a registration request if a Rekey SA

          <t>There may be circumstances where the GCKS may want to start over 
          with a clean state, e.g., in case it runs out of available Sender-IDs. 
          The GCKS can signal deletion of all the Data-Security SAs by
          sending a Delete payload with an SPI value equal to zero.
          For example, if the GCKS wishes to remove the Rekey SA and all the
          Data-Security SAs, the GCKS sends a Delete payload with an SPI
          of zero and a Protocol ID of AH or ESP, followed by another Delete payload
          with an SPI of zero and a Protocol ID of GIKE_UPDATE. 
          </t>
          <t> If a GM receives a Delete payload with zero SPI and a Protocol ID
          of GIKE_UPDATE, it means that the GM is excluded from the group. 
          Such Delete payload may be received either in the GSA_REKEY pseudo-exchange or in the GSA_INBAND_REKEY exchange.
          In this situation, the GM <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> re-register if it wants to continue 
          participating in this group. The registration is performed as described
          in <xref target="registration"/>. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that a GM waits some randomly chosen time
          before initiating a registration request in this situation to avoid overloading the GCKS.
          This document doesn't specify the maximum delay, which is implementation-dependent,
          but it is believed that the order of seconds suits most situations.
          Note that if the unicast SA between the GM and the GCKS exists, then the GM may use the GSA_REGISTRATION exchange 
          to re-register. However, after excluding a GM from the group, the GCKS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> 
          immediately delete the unicast SA with this GM (if any) if the credentials of this GM are revoked.

        <t>Several counter-based modes of operation have been specified

        two senders in the group ever send a packet with the same
        IV using the same cipher key and mode. This
        requirement is met in G-IKEv2 when the following measures are

        <section anchor="sid_alloc">
          <name>Allocation of Sender-ID</name>
          <t>When at least one Data-Security SA included in the group policy
          includes a counter-based mode of operation, the GCKS automatically
          allocates and distributes one Sender-ID to each GM acting in the
          role of sender on the Data-Security SA. The Sender-ID value is used
          exclusively by the group sender to which it was allocated. The group
          sender uses the same Sender-ID for each Data-Security SA specifying the
          use of a counter-based mode of operation. A GCKS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> distribute
          unique keys for each Data-Security SA, including a counter-based mode
          of operation in order to maintain unique key and nonce usage.</t>
          <t>During registration, the group sender can choose to request one
          or more Sender-ID values. Requesting a value of 1 is not necessary since
          the GCKS will automatically allocate exactly one to the group
          sender. A group sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> request as many Sender-ID values matching the number
          of encryption modules in which it will be installing the TEKs in the
          outbound direction. Alternatively, a group sender <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> request more
          than one Sender-ID and use them serially. This could be useful when it is
          anticipated that the group sender will exhaust their range of Data-Security SA nonces using a single Sender-ID too quickly (e.g., before the
          time-based policy in the TEK expires).</t>
          <t>When the group policy includes a counter-based mode of operation,
          a GCKS should use the following method to allocate Sender-ID values, which
          ensures that each Sender-ID will be allocated to just one group
          sender.</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
              <t>A GCKS maintains a Sender-ID counter, which records the Sender-IDs that

              <t>Each time a Sender-ID is allocated, the current value of the

              <t>When the GCKS specifies a counter-based mode of operation in
          the Data-Security SA, a group sender may request a count of Sender-IDs 
          during registration in a Notify payload information of type SENDER.
          When the GCKS receives this request, it increments the Sender-ID counter
          once for each requested Sender-ID and distributes each Sender-ID value to the
          group sender. The GCKS should have a policy-defined upper bound for
          the number of Sender-ID values that it will return irrespective of the number
          requested by the GM.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>A GCKS allocates new Sender-ID values for each registration operation 
          by a group sender, regardless of whether the group
          sender had previously contacted the GCKS. In this way, the GCKS is
          not required to maintain a record of which Sender-ID values it had
          previously allocated to each group sender. More importantly, since
          the GCKS cannot reliably detect whether the group sender had sent
          data on the current group Data-Security SAs, it does not know what
          Data-Security counter-mode nonce values that a group sender has
          used. By distributing new Sender-ID values, the key server ensures that
          each time a conforming group sender installs a Data-Security SA, it
          will use a unique set of counter-based mode nonces.</t>

        <name>Replay Protection for Multicast Data-Security SAs</name>
        <t>IPsec provides anti-replay service as part of its security
        services.  With multicast extensions for IPsec, replay protection is not
        always possible to achieve (see <xref target="RFC3740"
        sectionFormat="of" section="6.1"/>). In particular, if there
        are many group senders for a Data-Security SA, then each of them will
        independently increment the Sequence Number field in the ESP header
        (see <xref target="RFC4303" sectionFormat="of"
        section="2.2"/> and <xref target="RFC4302"
        sectionFormat="of" section="2.5"/>), thus making it impossible
        for the group receivers to filter out replayed packets. However, if
        there is only one group sender for a Data-Security SA, then it is
        possible to achieve replay protection with some restrictions (see
        <xref target="antireplay"/>). The GCKS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> create
        several Data-Security SAs with the same traffic selectors allowing
        only a single group sender in each SA if it is desirable to get replay
        protection with multiple (but still a limited number) of group senders.
        </t>
        <t>IPsec architecture assumes that whether 
        anti-replay service is enabled or not is a local matter for an IPsec receiver. In other words, an IPsec sender always increments
        the Sequence Number field in the ESP/AH header and a receiver decides whether to check
        for replayed packets or not. Since it is known in some cases that the replay protection
        is not possible (like in an SA with many group senders), a new Transform ID 
        "32-bit Unspecified Numbers" is defined for the Sequence Numbers (SNs) Transform Type.
        Using this Transform ID, the GCKS can inform GMs that the uniqueness of sequence
        numbers for a given SA is not guaranteed. The decision of whether to enable anti-replay service 
        is still a local matter of a GM (in accordance with IPsec architecture).

   control other than LKH have also been proposed,
   for example, OFT <xref target="OFT"/> and Subset Difference <xref target="NNL"/>. These algorithms could be
      used with G-IKEv2 but are not specified as a part of this
      document.</t>
      <t>This specification assumes that all group keys, that are 
      sent to the GMs by the GCKS, are encrypted with some other keys,
      called Key Wrap Keys (KWKs). The Key Wrap Algorithm transform
      defines the algorithm used for key wrapping in the context of an SA.

      <section anchor="kwk">
        <name>Key Wrap Keys</name>
        <t>Every GM always knows at least one KWK -- the KWK that is associated with the IKE SA
        or multicast Rekey SA over which wrapped keys are sent.
        In this document, it is called default KWK and is denoted as "GSK_w".
        </t>
        <t>For the purpose of forward access control, the GCKS may provide each GM 
        with its personal KWK at the time of registration. Additionally, several intermediate KWKs that form a key 
        hierarchy and are shared among several GMs may be provided by the GCKS.
        </t>
        <t>Each KWK is associated with a key wrap algorithm specified in the Key Wrap Algorithm transform.
        The size of these KWKs is determined by the key wrap algorithm used,
        but it <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be less than the size of the key for the Encryption Algorithm transform
        for the Rekey SA and for all Data-Security SAs in the group (taking the Key Length attribute into consideration if it is present).

          <name>Forward Access Control Requirements</name>
          <t>When a group membership is altered using a group management
          algorithm, new Data-Security SAs and their associated keys are usually
          also needed. New Data-Security SAs and keys ensure that members who were
          denied access can no longer participate in the group.</t>
          <t>If forward access control is a desired property of the group,
          a new TEK policy and the associated keys <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be included 
          in a G-IKEv2 rekey message, which changes group membership. 
          This is required because the GSA TEK policy
          and the associated keys are not protected with the new KEK. 
          A second G-IKEv2 rekey message can
          deliver the new GSA TEK policies and their associated keys 
          because it will be protected with the new KEK and thus will not
          be visible to the members who were denied access.</t>
          <t>If forward access control policy for the group includes
          keeping group policy changes from members that are denied access
          to the group, then two sequential G-IKEv2 rekey messages
          changing the group KEK <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent by the GCKS. The first
          G-IKEv2 rekey message creates a new KEK for the group. GMs, which are denied access, will not be able to access the
          new KEK, but they will see the group policy since the G-IKEv2 rekey
          message is protected under the current KEK. A subsequent G-IKEv2
          rekey message containing the changed group policy and again
          changing the KEK allows complete forward access control. A
          G-IKEv2 rekey message <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> change the policy without
          creating a new KEK.</t>
          <t>If other methods of using LKH or other group management
          algorithms are added to G-IKEv2, those methods <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> remove the
          above restrictions requiring multiple G-IKEv2 rekey messages,
          providing those methods specify how the forward access control
          policy is maintained within a single G-IKEv2 rekey message.</t>

        <name>GM Key Management Semantics</name>
        <t>This specification defines GM Key Management semantics
        in such a way that it doesn't depend on the key management
        method employed by the GCKS. This allows having all the complexity
        of key management in the GCKS, which is free to implement various
        key management methods such as direct transmitting of group SA
        keys or using some kind of key hierarchy (e.g., LKH). 
        The GM behavior is the same for all of these policies.
        </t>
        <t>All keys in G-IKEv2 are transmitted in encrypted form as specified 
        in <xref target="wrapped_key"/>. This format includes a 32-bit Key ID
        (ID of a key that is encrypted) and a 32-bit KWK ID
        (ID of a key that was used to encrypt this key). Keys may be 
        encrypted either with a default KWK (GSK_w) or with other keys,
        which the GM has received in the WRAP_KEY attributes.
        If a key was encrypted with GSK_w, then the KWK ID field is set to zero.
        Otherwise, the KWK ID field identifies the key used for encryption.
        A zero Key ID always identifies the key from which the keys for protecting Data-Security SAs and Rekey SA are taken.
        </t>
        <t>When a GM receives a message from the GCKS installing the new Data-Security or Rekey SA,
        it will contain a KD payload with an SA_KEY attribute containing keying material for this SA.
        For a Data-Security SA, exactly one SA_KEY attribute will be present
        with both Key ID and KWK ID fields set to zero. This means that the 
        default KWK (GSK_w) should be used to extract this keying material.
        </t>
        <t>For a multicast Rekey SA, multiple SA_KEY attributes may be present 
        depending on the key management method employed by the GCKS. If multiple SA_KEY attributes 
        are present, then all of them <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the same keying material encrypted using different KWKs.
        The GM in general is unaware of the key management method used by the GCKS and can always use the same procedure to get 
        the keys. The GM tries to decrypt at least one of the SA_KEY attributes
        using either the GSK_w or the keys from the WRAP_KEY attributes that are present in the same message  
        or were received in previous messages.
        </t>
        <t>We will use the term "Key Path" to describe an ordered sequence of keys 
        where each subsequent key was used to encrypt the previous one.
        The GM keeps its own Key Path (called Working Key Path) in the memory associated
        with each group it is registered to and updates it when needed.
        When the GSA_REKEY message is received, the GM processes the received SA_KEY attributes 
        one by one and tries to construct a new key path that starts from one of these attributes and 
        ends with any key in the Working Key Path or with the default KWK (GSK_w). 
        </t>
        <t>In the simplest case, the SA_KEY attribute is encrypted
        with GSK_w so that the new Key Path is empty. 
        If more complex key management methods are used, then a Key Path will
        contain intermediate keys from the WRAP_KEY attributes
        received by a GM so far, starting from its registration to the group. If the GM is able 
        to construct a new Key Path using intermediate keys it has, then it is able to decrypt the SA_KEY attribute 
        and use its content to form new SA keys. If it is unable to build a new Key Path, then it means that the GM is excluded
        from the group.
        </t>
        <t>Depending on the new Key Path, the GM should do the following actions to be prepared for future key updates:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>If the new Key Path is empty, then no actions are needed. This may happen 
          if no WRAP_KEY attributes from the received message were used.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>If the new Key Path is non-empty and it ends with the default KWK (GSK_w), then the whole new 
          Key Path is stored by the GM as the GM's Working Key Path.

This situation may only happen at the time the GM is registering to the group,
          when the GCKS is providing the GM with its personal key and the other keys from the key tree that are needed.
          These keys form an initial Working Key Path for this GM.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>In all other cases, the new Key Path will end at some intermediate key from the GM's current Working Key Path. 
          In this case, the new Key Path is constructed by replacing a part of the GM's current Working Key Path from the beginning and up to (but not including) 
          the key that the GM has used to decrypt the last key in the new Key Path.
            </t>

          <t>Group policies are comprised of two types: group SA policy and
          group-wide (GW) policy. Group SA policy defines parameters for the
          Security Association of the group. Depending on the employed
          security protocol, a group SA policy may be either a Rekey SA (GSA
          KEK) policy or a Data-Security (GSA TEK) SA policy. GSA payload may
          contain zero or one GSA KEK policy, zero or more GSA TEK policies,
          and zero or one GW policy, where either one GSA KEK or one GSA TEK
          policy <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present.</t>
          <t>This latitude allows various group policies to be accommodated.
          For example, if the group policy does not require the use of a Rekey
          SA, the GCKS would not need to send a GSA KEK policy to the group
          member since all SA updates would be performed using the GSA_INBAND_REKEY exchange via the 
          unicast IKE SA. Alternatively, group policy might use a Rekey SA
          but choose to download a KEK to the GM only as part of the
          unicast IKE SA. Therefore, the GSA KEK policy would not be
          necessary as part of the GSA_REKEY message.</t>
          <t>Specifying multiple GSA TEKs allows multiple related data streams
          (e.g., video, audio, and text) to be associated with a session, but
          each are protected with an individual Security Association.</t>
          <t>A GW policy allows for the distribution of group-wide policy,
          such as instructions for when to activate and deactivate SAs.</t>
          <t>Policies are distributed in substructures to the GSA payload.
          The format of the substructures is defined in <xref target="gsa_policy"/>
          (for group SA policy) and in <xref target="gw_policy"/> (for GW policy).
          The first octet of the substructure unambiguously determines its type;
          it is zero for GW policy and non-zero (actually, it contains a Security Protocol Identifier)
          for group SA policies.

            <dt>Protocol (1 octet):</dt><dd>Identifies the security protocol
            for this group SA.  The values are defined in the "IKEv2 Security
            Protocol Identifiers" registry in <xref target="IKEV2-IANA"/>. The valid
            values for this field are 6 (GIKE_UPDATE) for Rekey SA
            and 2 (AH) or 3 (ESP) for Data-Security SAs.</dd>
            <dt>SPI Size (1 octet):</dt><dd>Size of the SPI
            for the SA.  SPI size depends on the SA protocol. It is 16 octets for GIKE_UPDATE and 4 octets for AH and ESP.</dd>

            <dt>SPI (variable):</dt><dd>Security Parameter Index for the group SA.
            The size of this field is determined by the SPI Size field.
            As described above, these SPIs are assigned by the GCKS. 
            In the case of GIKE_UPDATE, the SPI is the IKEv2 header SPI pair where the
            first 8 octets become the "IKE SA Initiator's SPI" field in the
            G-IKEv2 rekey message IKEv2 HDR, and the second 8 octets become
            the "IKE SA Responder's SPI" in the same HDR.</dd>

            identities. The format for these substructures is defined in IKEv2

            <t>For the Rekey SA (with the GIKE_UPDATE protocol), the
            destination traffic selectors <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> define a single
            multicast IP address, an IP protocol (assumed to be UDP), and a
            single port the GSA_REKEY messages will be destined to. In this case, the source
            traffic selector <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> define a
            single IP address, an IP protocol (assumed to be UDP), and a single
            port the GSA_REKEY messages will be originated from.  The source
            traffic selector <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> define a wildcard IP address
            and/or wildcard port. For the Data-Security (AH and ESP) SAs, the
            destination traffic selectors will usually define a single
            multicast IP address.  The source traffic selector in this case
            will usually define a single IP address or be a wildcard selector.
            An IP protocol and ports define the characteristics of traffic
            protected by this Data-Security SA.</t>
            <t>If the Data-Security SAs are created in tunnel mode, then it
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be tunnel mode with address preservation (see

              This transform describes the properties of sequence numbers of IPsec packets. There are currently two Transform IDs
              defined for this Transform Type: "32-bit Sequential Numbers" and "Partially Transmitted 64-bit Sequential Numbers"
              that correspond to non-ESN and ESN cases from AH <xref target="RFC4302"/> and ESP <xref target="RFC4303"/> specifications.

              </t>
              <t>Since both AH <xref target="RFC4302"/> and ESP <xref target="RFC4303"/> are defined in such a way that high-order 32 bits of extended sequence numbers are never transmitted, it makes using ESN in multicast Data-Security SAs
              problematic because GMs that join the group long after it is created will have to somehow learn the current high-order 32 bits
              of ESN for each sender in the group. The algorithm for doing this described in AH <xref target="RFC4302"/>
              and ESP <xref target="RFC4303"/> is resource-consuming and is only suitable when a receiver is able to guess
              the high-order 32 bits close enough to its real value, which is not the case for multicast SAs. 
              For this reason, the "Partially Transmitted 64-bit Sequential Numbers" Transform ID  
              <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used for multicast Data-Security SAs utilizing protocols ESP or AH.

              <t> This document defines a new Transform ID 
              for this Transform Type: "32-bit Unspecified Numbers" (2). This Transform ID defines the following properties:</t>
<ul><li>Sequence numbers are
32 bits in size and are transmitted in the Sequence Number field of AH and ESP
packets.</li>  
<li>The value of sequence numbers is not guaranteed to be unique for the
duration of an SA, thus they are not suitable for replay protection.</li></ul>
<t>This
Transform ID <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used by the GCKS in case of multi-sender
multicast Data-Security SAs utilizing protocols ESP or AH to inform the GMs
that the replay protection is not expected to be possible.  The GCKS
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also use this Transform ID for single-sender multicast
Data-Security SAs if replay protection is not needed (e.g., it is done on
the application level).

              <t>The optional GSA_NEXT_SPI attribute (3) contains the SPI that the GCKS reserved  
              for the next Rekey SA or Data-Security SAs replacing the current ones. The length of the attribute data
              is determined by the SPI Size field in the group SA policy substructure the attribute
              resides in (see <xref target="gsa_policy"/>), and the attribute data contains the
              SPI as it would appear on the network. Multiple attributes of this type <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be included,
              meaning that any of the supplied SPIs can be used in the replacement group SA.
              </t>
              <t>The GM <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> store these values. Later on, if the GM starts receiving 
              messages with one of these SPIs without seeing a rekey message over the current Rekey SA, then
              it may be used as an indication that the rekey message got lost on its way to this GM.
              In this case, the GM <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> re-register to the group.
              </t>
              <t>Note that this method of detecting lost rekey messages can only be used 
              by group receivers. Additionally, there is no point to include this attribute in the GSA_INBAND_REKEY messages
              since they use reliable transport. Also note that the GCKS is free 
              to forget its promises and not to use the SPIs it sent in the GSA_NEXT_SPI 
              attributes before (e.g., in cases where the GCKS is rebooted), so the GM must only treat
              this information as a "best effort" made by the GCKS to prepare for future rekeys.

              <t>This attribute <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used if inband rekey (via the GSA_INBAND_REKEY exchange) is employed by the GCKS for the GM.

              <t>The GWP_ATD attribute (1) allows a GCKS to set the

          <t> Keys are distributed in substructures called key bags. Each key bag contains one or more keys

For this reason, two types of key bags are defined: Group Key Bag and
   Member Key Bag. The type is unambiguously determined by the first byte of
   the key bag substructure; for a Member Key Bag, it is zero and for a Group
   Key Bag, it contains a Security Protocol Identifier, which is always non-zero. 
   For a Group Key Bag, the Protocol along with the SPI (see <xref target="group_key_bag_format"/>) 
   identify the SA that is associated with the keys in this bag.

          <name>Key Wrapping</name>	  
          <t>Symmetric keys in G-IKEv2 are never sent in clear inside G-IKEv2 messages.
          They are always protected with other symmetric keys. This protection is called key wrapping.
          Algorithms used for key wrapping are usually based on generic encryption algorithms,
          but their mode of operation is optimized for protecting short high-entropy data with minimal additional overhead.
          While key wrap algorithms can be generic in general, they are often tied to the underlying
          encryption algorithms in practice. For example, AES Key Wrap with Padding Algorithm <xref target="RFC5649"/> defines key wrapping using AES,
          and Key Wrapping Constructions using SipHash and ChaCha <xref target="ARX-KW"/> define key wrapping using Chacha20.
          </t>


<t>In G-IKEv2, the key wrap algorithm <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be negotiated in the
 IKE_SA_INIT exchange so that the GCKS is able to send encrypted keys
 to the GM in the GSA_AUTH exchange.  In addition, if the GCKS plans
 to use the multicast Rekey SA for group rekey, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify
 the key wrap algorithm in the group SA policy for the Rekey SA inside the GSA payload. Note that key wrap algorithms 
          for these cases <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be different. For the unicast SA, the key wrap algorithm is negotiated
          between the GM and the GCKS, while for the multicast Rekey SA, the key wrap algorithm
          is provided by the GCKS to the GMs as part of the group policy.
          If an SAg payload is included in the GSA_AUTH request, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> indicate which key wrap algorithms are supported by the GM.
          In all these cases, the key wrap algorithm is specified in a Key Wrap Algorithm transform (see <xref target="wrapping_alg"/>).
          </t>
          <t> The format of the wrapped key is shown in <xref target="key_format"/>.

      <name>Interaction with IKEv2 and ESP Extensions</name>
      <t>A number of IKEv2 and ESP extensions are defined that can be used to extend
      protocol functionality. G-IKEv2 is compatible with most of them.
      In particular, EAP authentication defined in <xref target="RFC7296"/> can be used 
      to establish registration IKE SA, as well as EAP-only authentication <xref target="RFC5998"/> and 
      secure password authentication <xref target="RFC6467"/>. 
      G-IKEv2 is compatible with and can use IKEv2 Redirect Mechanism <xref target="RFC5685"/> and 
      IKEv2 Session Resumption <xref target="RFC5723"/>. 
      G-IKEv2 is also compatible with Multiple Key Exchanges in the IKEv2 
      framework, as defined in <xref target="RFC9370"/>.
      </t>
      <t>The above list of compatible IKEv2 extensions is not exhaustive. However, some IKEv2 
      extensions require special handling if used in G-IKEv2.
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>Implicit IV for Counter-Based Ciphers in ESP</name>
        <t> Using implicit IV for counter-based encryption modes in ESP is defined in <xref target="RFC8750"/>.
        This extension relies on the uniqueness of ESP sequence numbers. Thus, it cannot be used for multi-sender
        multicast SAs. However, it is possible to use implicit IV extension for a single-sender multicast ESP SA.
        Note that while implicit IVs can be used with ESN, using ESN is prohibited 
        in multicast SAs (see <xref target="antireplay"/>).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Mixing Preshared Keys in IKEv2 for Post-Quantum Security</name>
        <t>G-IKEv2 can take advantage of the protection provided by
        Post-quantum Preshared Keys (PPKs) for IKEv2 <xref target="RFC8784"/>. However, the use of 
        PPKs leaves the initial IKE SA susceptible to quantum
        computer (QC) attacks. Group SA keys are protected with 
        the default KWK (GSK_w), which is derived from SK_d and thus 
        cannot be broken even by an attacker equipped with a QC.
        However, other data sent over the initial IKE SA may 
        be susceptible to an attacker equipped with a QC of a sufficient size. Such an attacker can store all the traffic 
        until it obtains such a QC and then decrypt it (i.e., Store Now Decrypt Later attack).
        See <xref target="RFC8784" sectionFormat="of" section="6"/> for details.
        </t>
        <t>While the group keys are protected with PPK and thus are immune to QC, GCKS implementations that care about other data sent over initial IKE SA 
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> rely on IKEv2 extensions that protect even initial IKE SA against QC
        (like <xref target="RFC9867"/>).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Aggregation and Fragmentation Mode for ESP</name>
        <t>Aggregation and fragmentation mode for ESP is defined in <xref target="RFC9347"/>. This mode allows IP packets to 
        be split over several ESP packets or several IP packets to be aggregated in a single ESP packet.
        This mode can only be used with ESP tunnel mode and relies on monotonically increasing sequence numbers
        in the incoming packets. Thus, it is impossible to use this mode for multi-sender multicast SAs.
        Since multicast Data-Security SAs are unidirectional, the congestion control feature of aggregation and fragmentation mode cannot be used.
        </t>
        <t> It is possible to use the aggregation and fragmentation mode without congestion control for a single-sender multicast ESP SA created in tunnel mode.
        GMs supporting this mode can send the USE_AGGFRAG notification in the registration request along with the SAg payload.
        If the Data-Security SA(s) to be installed on GMs uses the aggregation and fragmentation mode, the GCKS would indicate it by including 
        the USE_AGGFRAG notification along with the GSA payload in its response.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="gdoi_ext">
      <name>GDOI Protocol Extensions</name>
      <t> Few extensions were defined for the GDOI protocol <xref target="RFC6407"/>, like 
        GDOI Support for IEC 62351 Security Services <xref target="RFC8052"/> or the GDOI GROUPKEY-PUSH Acknowledgement Message <xref target="RFC8263"/>. 
        It is expected that these extensions will be redefined for G-IKEv2 in separate documents, if needed.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section>
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t> When an entity joins the group and becomes a GM, it has to  
      trust that the GCKS only authorized entities that are admitted to the group and 
      has to trust that other GMs will not leak the information shared within the group.
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>GSA Registration and Secure Channel</name>
<t>G-IKEv2 registration procedure uses IKEv2 initial exchanges,
 inheriting all the security considerations documented in <xref target="RFC7296"       
sectionFormat="of" section="5"/>, including authentication, confidentiality, on-path attack
 protection, protection against replay/reflection attacks, and denial-
 of-service protection.  The GSA_REGISTRATION exchange
 also takes advantage of those protections.
        In addition, G-IKEv2 brings in the
        capability to authorize a particular GM regardless of
        whether they have the IKEv2 credentials.</t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>GSA Maintenance Channel</name>
        <t>The GSA maintenance channel is cryptographically and integrity
        protected using the cryptographic algorithm and key negotiated in the
        GSA member registration exchange.</t>
        <section>
          <name>Authentication/Authorization</name>
          <t>The authentication key is distributed during the GM registration 
          and the receiver of the rekey message uses that key to verify the message came 
          from the authorized GCKS.
An implicit authentication can also be used, in which case,
   the ability of the GM to decrypt and to verify ICV of 
   incoming messages is used as a proof that the sender
   knows group keys and therefore is a member of the group.
          However, implicit authentication doesn't provide source origin authentication, so the GM cannot be sure
          that the message came from the GCKS. For this reason, using implicit
          authentication is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>
          unless used with a small group of trusted parties.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Confidentiality</name>
          <t>Confidentiality is provided by distributing a confidentiality key
          as part of the GSA member registration exchange.</t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>On-Path Attack Protection</name>
          <t>The GSA maintenance channel is integrity protected by using a digital
          signature.</t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Replay/Reflection Attack Protection</name>
          <t>The GSA_REKEY message includes a monotonically increasing
          sequence number to protect against replay and reflection attacks. A
          GM will recognize a replayed message by comparing the
          Message ID number to that of the last received rekey message. Any
          rekey message containing a Message ID number less than or equal to
          the last received value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be discarded. Implementations should
          keep a record of recently received GSA rekey messages for this
          comparison.</t>
          <t>The strict role separation between the GCKS and the GMs and, as a consequence, 
          the limitation for a Rekey SA to be outbound/inbound only, helps to prevent reflection attack.

          <name>Guidance for Designated Experts</name>
          <t> In all cases of Expert Review described in this section,
           the designated expert (DE) is expected to ascertain the existence of suitable
           documentation (a specification) as described in <xref target="RFC8126"/> and 
           verify that the document is permanently and publicly available.  The
           DE is also expected to check the clarity of purpose and use of the
           requested code points. Lastly, the DE must verify that any specification produced outside the IETF does not
           conflict with work that is active or already published within the IETF.

      <name>Use of LKH in G-IKEv2</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC2627" sectionFormat="of" section="5.4"/> describes the LKH
      architecture and how a GCKS uses LKH to exclude GMs. This
      section clarifies how the LKH architecture is used with G-IKEv2.</t>
      <section anchor="lkh_notation">
        <name>Notation</name>
        <t>In this section, we will use the notation X{Y}, 
        where a key with ID Y is encrypted with the key with ID X.
        The notation GSK_w{Y} means that the default wrap key GSK_w (with zero KWK ID)is used 
        to encrypt key Y, and the notation X{K_sa} means key X is used 
        to encrypt the SA key K_sa (which always has a Key ID of zero). Note that GSK_w{K_sa} means that
        the SA key is encrypted with the default wrap key, in which case, both KWK ID and Key ID are zero.
        </t>
        <t>The content of the KD payload will be shown as a sequence
        of key bags. The Group Key Bag substructure will be denoted as GP(SAn)()
        when n is an SPI for the SA and the Member Key Bag substructure
        will be denoted as MP(). The content of the key bags 
        is shown as SA_KEY and WRAP_KEY attributes with the notation
        described above. For simplicity, the type of the attribute will not be shown
        because it is implicitly defined by the type of key bag.
        </t>
        <t>Below is the example of a KD payload:</t>

<figure title="Example of a KD Payload">
        <artwork><![CDATA[
KD(GP(SA1)(X{K_sa}),MP(Y{X},Z{Y},GSK_w{Z})
]]></artwork>
</figure>

        <t>
        For simplicity, any other attributes in the KD payload are omitted.
        </t>
        <t>We will also use the notation X-&gt;Y-&gt;Z
        to describe the Key Path. In this case, key Y is needed to decrypt key X and key Z is needed to decrypt key Y.
        In the example above, the keys had the following relation: K_sa-&gt;X-&gt;Y-&gt;Z-&gt;GSK_w.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Group Creation</name>
        <t>When a GCKS forms a group, it creates a key tree as shown in
        <xref target="initial-tree"/>. The key tree contains logical keys (which are represented as
        the values of their Key IDs in the figure) and a private key shared with only a single GM
        (the GMs are represented as letters followed by the corresponding 
        key ID in parentheses in the figure). The root of the tree contains the
        multicast Rekey SA key (which is represented as SAn(K_san). The figure below assumes that the Key IDs
        are assigned sequentially; this is not a requirement and only used
        for illustrative purposes. The GCKS may create a complete tree as shown or a partial tree, which is
        created on demand as members join the group.

        <t>When GM A joins the group, the GCKS provides it
        with the keys in the KD payload of the GSA_AUTH or
        GSA_REGISTRATION exchange. Given the tree shown in figure above, the
        KD payload will be:

KD(GP(SA1)(1{K_sa1}),MP(3{1},7{3},GSK_w{7})
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>

        From these attributes, the GM A will construct 
        the Key Path K_sa1-&gt;1-&gt;3-&gt;7-&gt;GSK_w. Since it
        ends up with GSK_w, it will use all the WRAP_KEY attributes 
        present in the path as its Working Key Path: 1-&gt;3-&gt;7.
        </t>
        <t>Similarly, when other GMs join the group, they will be
  provided with the corresponding keys and thus the GMs
  will have the following Working Key Paths:

        <t>If the GCKS performs a simple SA rekey without changing group membership,
        it will only send a Group Key Bag in the KD payload with a new
        SA key encrypted with the default KWK.

        <name>Group Member Exclusion</name>
        <t>If the GCKS has reason to believe that a GM should be excluded,
        then it can do so by sending a GSA_REKEY message that includes a set
        of GM_KEY attributes, which would allow all GMs, except for the excluded one, 
        to get a new SA key.
        </t>
        <t>In the example below, the GCKS excludes GM F. For this purpose,
        it changes the key tree as follows, replacing key 2 with key 15 and
        key 5 with key 16. It also generates a new SA key for a new SA3.

        <t>Then it sends the following KD payload for the new Rekey SA3:

        While processing this KD payload:</t>

          <li>
            <t>GMs A, B, C, and D will be able to decrypt the SA_KEY attribute 1{K_sa3} by using
          the "1" key from their key path. Since no new GM_KEY attributes are in the new 
          Key Path, they won't update their Working Key Paths.
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>GMs G and H will construct new Key Path 15-&gt;6 and will be able to decrypt
          the intermediate key 15 using key 6 from their Working Key Paths. So, they will
          update their Working Key Paths replacing their beginnings up to key 6 
          with the new Key Path (thus replacing the key 2 with the key 15).
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>GM E will construct a new Key Path 16-&gt;15-&gt;11 and will be able to decrypt
          the intermediate key 16 using key 11 from its Working Key Path. So, it will
          update its Working Key Path replacing its beginnings up to key 11 
          with the new Key Path (thus replacing key 2 with key 15 and key 5 with key 16).
            </t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>GM F won't be able to construct any Key Path leading to any key it possesses,
          so it will be unable to decrypt the new SA key for the SA3. Thus, it will be excluded
          from the group once the SA3 is used.
            </t>
          </li>
        </ul>
